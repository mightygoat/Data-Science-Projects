"5.0 out of 5 stars","DJ","The Smartest of Them All!!! (Check out the video for a quick demo)","Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, ""Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees"" got no result, so I tried ""Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees"" and she picked it up perfectly.4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  ""Alexa, play 90s music"", ""Alexa, play indie music"", and ""Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds"".  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great ""freebie"" if you're a prime member.6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to ""Alexa, what's the definition of"", ""Alexa, how far away is"", ""Alexa, Wikipedia"" (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask ""Alexa, tell me more"").  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).Suggestions for Improvement:1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like ""How far away is the sun"" but I'd really like too see Amazon add a ""search"" function.2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings.","October 24, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Bryant R.","Best $50 I ever spent!!!!","So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.Thanks for letting me rant","January 10, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","RaVen","A huge improvement over last years release and for half the price","Thanks for taking the time to read this review!This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say ""alexa"" and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.  We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its ""multi-room voice recognition"" technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word ""alexa"" on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a ""multi-device"" plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited  The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.  At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is ""alexa turn on the lights"" and our downstairs lights spring into action.  My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with ""sorry I didn't get that""Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.  Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your ""free"" music.  I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up ""New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing"" under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.  I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device.","October 24, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Brian C","Speakers Are Perfectly Fine For Our Living Room & Kitchen","There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo ""skills"" that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the ""skills"" not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached.","December 14, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","LUCY  Von","Wonderful darling Dot!","I got Dot about a week after the big Echo from my son as a gift. We set her up and all was fine. Until nothing eas fine anymore 😢 . She would respond initially, but not always though, and when she was playing music she would not respond to the wake word. At all. I reset, few times, but nithing worked. I called Amazon. Within minutes they had me connected to Echo's tech support, and in no time did we have Dot fixed. They reset her factory settings with me. We tested and now our darling little Dot is happy and healthy! So call Amazon if you do have issues, it's a matter of setup or wifi or in any case, something that they can fix. Wonderful support for a wondrful device. I do wish I could call her Dot though. Or a name that I choose. Because now I have two Alexa's in one household 🤔, and calling her Echo or Amazon ain't gonna work for me 😢. Please vote my review up if you liked it.","January 11, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Andrew","Completely Worth The $50","This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: ""Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke."" The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy ""command station"" was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.","March 26, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Cynthia J. Salim","DOT can be frustrating","DOT can be frustrating but I do enjoy the convenience when it works. I have two DOTS and a speakers connected to each DOT. Each DOT is used on a different floor of my home. The DOT in my bedroom is connected to a speaker by WIFI also connected to that DOT is a smart plug that controls a lamp. The DOT in my living area is connected using a cable to a speaker. I intend to have smart thermostats installed and connected too. I enjoy the music selection available using DOT. And,  I enjoy the convenience of weather reports, news, time, alarms, etc.My beef is that sometimes DOT does not work using the voice mode. I can usually get what I want by going into my ALEXA APP and making a manual request. This happens most often at night when I want to have my lamp turned off or my music turned on. I am not sure why this happens. Generally, in the morning when I try the same request that failed at night, it works. When these failures occur, I check to make sure WiFi is working and it always is. ALEXA also lights up indicating that she hears me but does not execute the request. I am starting to wonder if I have made a mistake by buying the expensive Smart thermostats.If anyone has any tips on how to get DOT to be more consistent, please share.","March 9, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Kainesmith.ky","The good and the bad","I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.I like the ""to do list"" and ""shopping list"" feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most.","December 30, 2016"

"1.0 out of 5 stars","william","NEEDS SECURITY!!!!","NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it.","February 14, 2017"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","AReview4U","JUST OK","UPDATE TO REVIEW BELOW:  I have 3 of these set up in my house.  I've already had to exchange one because it quit working.  Now 2 of the other 3 all of a sudden can NEVER hear you - you have to yell at it, whereas before they all worked just fine.  ALSO, I ask/tell it to do something, like turn off a light, and it gives me an answer that is totally unrelated to anything even close to the words I've said.  I'm beginning to think maybe I should try that other one of these things that are out there by another company because these are not holding up.  ALSO, out of the blue I am simply sitting on my couch BY MYSELF surfing the net, and all of a sudden she starts talking for no reason whatsoever.  I do not have the tv on; I'm not talking to myself; so WTF!  I'm becoming less and less enamored with this product, and I've bought about 10 of them - 3 for myself, 2 for my boyfriend and the others I've given out for gifts or plan to (Christmas is almost here).  I normally don't rag on something on here BUT I've bought enough of these that they better not all start messing up, like 2 of my 3 are already doing.  Who wants to have to yell at something for it to respond - AND OH, just so you know, I'm standing with 6' of it - I'm not 50' away.  RIGHT NEXT TO IT and I get NOTHING.  Then I yell, and all of a sudden the stupid thing responds.  Did I mention I was ANNOYED!!!I received my Echos timely and packaged well.  I am in LOVE with this little thing.  It works perfectly for me so far.  I have had a time or 2 when it simply would spin and not respond, but not enough to cause me to want to return it. I have one in my living room and one in my bedroom.  While it does reach out, for me, I don't want to have to yell to it from a distance.  Also, it connected to my Samsung bluetooth soundbar instantly (even though my speaker is not on the ""approved"" list you see here on Amazon).  It has come in so handy numerous times, like asking a quick question I have without having to pull out the tablet or phone to look it up; I have intergrated my google calendar so it will tell me what's on the schedule for the day or week.  I have also integrated the music from my Samsung S7 and it plays all my music as soon as I ask it to.  I have it hooked up to my Hue lights, and it works great from Alexa's standpoint - the Hue lights are a hit or miss as they often keep losing the connection to the bridge - even with the light in the same room as the router.  If this doesn't stop, they'll be going back because at $200 for my Hue kit, these things should not keep losing a connection and becoming undiscoverable - BUT, that has nothing to do with the Alexa.  If you don't have one of these, I highly recommend it.  It is handy as can be and ONLY $49.  What a dream gadget.  MY ONE SUGGESTION IS THIS THOUGH.  IT IS AN AMAZON DEVICE SO WHY DOESN'T IT HAVE A SKILL TO TURN ON OUR AMAZON FIRESTICK!!!","October 26, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Manders","I like the Echo Dot.","I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can ""learn"" other ""Skills"" but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be ""turned on"". The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter.","December 15, 2016"

The closest Echo or Dot gives you your answer or replies to your commands.  Thank you Amazon!  (BTW - my older products updated so they also have ESP now).The new Dots are a bit smaller and are shiny unlike the first generation that was a flat black.  Installation was easy and only took a couple of minutes for each to connect to my network (using the Alexa app).Size: NEW - 1.3""x3.3""x3.3"" 5.7oz OLD - 1.5""x3.3""x3.3"" 8.8ozVolume Adjustment: NEW - volume up and down buttons OLD - volume ringWarranty: NEW - 90 days included OLD - 1 year includedYou do not get a 3.5 mm audio cable included with the new dot.New color choice of white.Price is $30 cheaper than the first generation dots.I know that Amazon was the first one to really grab the market with these types of devices - beating out the Google and Apple devices (well, Siri on Apple products).  At first she (my girl Alexa) didn't do much more than play some songs and figured out difficult mathematical problems for me.  Now they have all gotten a lot smarter!  I turn lights on and off, adjust my thermostat, play music, find my phone, set timers/alarms and most of all my shopping list!  I love this concept and the Amazon technology involved.  Most of the time I am an Apple geek and stick to that brand but I do 90% of my online shopping through Amazon so they just work great together.  I know that in the future these little devices will do so much more and become a real part of my everyday life.  Right now they are a footstep into the future they promised me when I was a little boy (I grew up watching the Jetsons!).Both devices came well packed without excessive packing materials.  Now at this price-point I have them all over my house so no matter where I am she comes to life and takes care of me.I wish there was a portable battery base that you could buy so you could take it outside if needed.  Right now you have to plug it into a wall outlet.Here is some of my wishlist items for the future software updates:  Work on her voice a bit and give her a little more of a human voice and less mechanical (I don't want to say robotic because it is not like that).  The Echo family needs to learn the host better and anticipate what they want like knowing at certain times of day I do this or that.  Build in voice remote services for TVs, Fire and other streaming devices so we can ditch our remote controls.I have taken a few pictures to show you the visual difference between the first generation Dot and the new Dot.  These pictures were taken by me and I'm not a professional photographer so remember they are just here for a visual.  I'll post more pics later and maybe a video.  I really appreciate you reading my review and I try to be as honest as possible.  If you have any questions for me just ask and I'll do what I can to answer them.  So if you are thinking about getting one of these gagits then go ahead and do it - it is worth the price and before you know it you will have them all over your house.","October 24, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Forrest","A true all-in -ne solution that is better than Chromecast Audio!","Just recieved my Echo Dot a few days ago as a graduation gift and it has been truly life changing! This is the all-in-one solution I have been looking for my old Sony G Box. Prior to this I was using Chromecast audio and a Bluetooth adapter that fit on top of the iPod dock using the old apple standard so I would have to constantly walk up to the box and switch between Bluetooth and castiing which took up a lot of time. The reason I did this was because I like to stream from multiple music services like Apple Music and Spotify but you could only listen over wifi with Spotify because Apple Music doesn't support it.Echo Dot has Bluetooth built in so I can seamlessly switch to services (like Apple Music) that don't support wifi streaming with just a simple voice command!Speaking of voice commands so far Alexa has been able to understand me most of the time and it's been really convient. You do have to give up some privacy with the voice commands but there is a switch on the device to turn the mic off which is nice.My only issue is not with the device itself but with the Alexa app. Amazon needs more developers to work on it to make it more intuitive and faster. Right now the app feels clunky and slow. If Amazon can fix this issue than it will be perfect. I'm still giving a five star rating because the device is just so good.","December 25, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Axiom Brevity","Is It Worth It?"," Hello Everyone,To start off my review I just wanted to mention that this product was not provided to me at a discount or free and I purchased it with my own funds.=========================================================================================================Price Point=========Fantastic! Why? Because if you're unsure of the uprising smart home trend but want to get your feet wet The New Echo Dot isn't such a heavy investment. Coming in around $50, this lets you experiment and get a taste of what everyone is talking about without breaking the bank.===================================================================================================So what comes inside the box?=======================(1x) Echo Dot (2nd Gen)(1x) 9-watt Power Adapter(1x) Micro USB cable(1x) Quick Start Guide* 3.5 mm aux cable sold separately*==========================================The Design===========================This smart home automation device resembles the dimensions of a well-dressed hockey puck. It has four buttons on it's halo-like top as well as seven microphones underneath the hood. There's a pair of buttons to increase and decrease the volume. Next you have the mute button than finally the action button for pairing the Dot to your WI-FI and/or Bluetooth devices. The speaker introduced with this model isn't too bad and deserves a bit of respect in terms of providing a decent sound for a Bluetooth transmitter, that being said there is always room for improvement. There is an illuminated edge that follows along the circular rim and lights up when alexa is speaking and called to action. The siding has a glossy finish with the USB connection and 3.5 mm aux port embedded on back to manually connect to speakers sporting the same connector. Beneath the device lies a rubber-like pad to add grip to keep it stationary on most surfaces. On the top and bottom you'll find tiny symmetrical holes for the mic's receivers to pick up on your voice as well as to help with distributing the output evenly.==========================================================================================================Functionality=========Alexa can do multiple things from controlling your thermostat, to ordering you an uber, and even playing jeopardy and solving math problems. She was mainly created to be an assistant in many fashions and is continually being integrated into appliances. I personally use the Dot for listening to music on my Bluetooth speaker, updates on weather forecasts, amazon shopping and package tracking, using Wikipedia, searching movie times and a personal reading assistant for my audible books but the list is growing seeing as she learns new skills every month and all you have to do is enable them through the Alexa app. I don't have any smart home toys to control but from my research she works more efficiently than any of the competitors (cough)(cough) Google Home.P.S. - Her jokes are corny...====================================================My Opinion-----------------This is a great opportunity for tech enthusiast and skeptics alike, as well as soccer moms and busy dads to dabble in the likes of smart home assistants. I find that the more I go through the learning curve with the Dot the more I see a practical use for it but don't get me wrong, artificial intelligence still gives me goose bumps and it's hard to get the terminator's skynet out of my brain. So I keep mine unplugged when not in use. Now, while the speaker is impressive for the quality in such a small package it will still tempt you to connect it to a more vibrant sound source so get a good speaker to pair it with.All in all,  it's not a finished product but it is the best option out there at the moment even more so for newbies and curious hopefuls treading into AI device land in terms of quality and tender. Try it out and who knows you might even find it useful.My verdict, it's worth it!Axiom Brevity==========[...] You can also check out all my other reviews on You Tube @ Axiom Brevity.Thank you for your time.","January 18, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Manders","I like the Echo Dot.","I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can ""learn"" other ""Skills"" but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be ""turned on"". The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours. The Dot works Great, I am hoping that Alexa herself will get smarter.","December 15, 2016"

I waited almost a year before investing in this little baby and having the option to pay $10.00 a month was a no brainer. I was not fond of the full sound that comes from the unit BUT that is the trade off when buying into a portable sound item (keep in mind that you have to have the DOT plugged in unless you use another power source like, an extended battery/charger which, I may look into. Soooo, I bought the Oontz Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth speaker WHICH some reviews claim it not so great however, I can tell you that it absolutely made all the difference for my needs. I come home from work and ask Alexa to play whatever genre I am in the mood to listen to INSTEAD of turning my TV on AND, I will tell you that I LOVE to watch my flicks but somehow this little DOT forces me to out my head into a place of less ""noise"". I choose to filter what is more important to me as, you should. Is the DOT perfect? is Alexa perfect? No, I ask Alexa questions like, ""when were humans first created?"", she cannot respond but ask her what the SUN is made up of or if there is a chance that life on MARS is possible and she will give you an answer. When you wake up, you can say, ""Alexa, Good Morning and she will respond. On April 1st, Fools Day, I said, ""Alexa, Goodnight"" and her response was, ""Good night and don't forget to fool someone before the day is over"", pretty smart technology. Do I plan on buying more, yes I do. Give it try but DO buy a separate portable speaker for an enhanced experience.","April 3, 2017"

I have the big one in black - Amazon Echo in the kitchen since it is my main area and I can hear all throughout my place. Great speakers! So convenient in the kitchen. Also I got for my birthday yesterday this small Echo Dot in white and works just as fine for a bedroom. Although it can't answer everything it answers my questions for the most part what I need it for. Great sound.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Nevada Woodchuck","Awesome, just plain awesome.","I already own an Echo and wanted something I could use in my shop rather than moving the Echo back and forth, so I ordered a Dot.  Took it out to my shop which is about 45 feet from my router, I figured that since the Echo worked out there,  the Dot should also.  Since speakers are not one of the Dot's strong points, I hooked up my Bose Roommates, plugged them into the Dot, then plugged in the Dot.  Alexa sounds great with real speakers.  The setup was extremely easy, and since the Echo was connected to the internet, the Dot had no trouble connecting, didn't even ask for the router password, I figured it used the Echo's connection.  The first thing I asked the Dot to do was play some music, with the Bose speakers the sound was awesome, even when I turned the volume up.  This has to be one of the better purchases I've made, now I have music in my shop, as well as in my computer room, and am extremely please with the Dot, how easy it was to set up on the first try, and no doubt the first of a few more for the rest of the house.  I was surprised by the size, Alexa in a hockey puck would describe it to a T.","April 7, 2017"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Br3al","Am I the only one that's disappointed?","After hearing all the hype around the line of echo products, I decided to give the echo dot a shot. My experience hasn't been as stellar as all the other reviews I read.My main issue is that the echo dot doesn't seem to handle any level of ambient noise above a whisper very well. If I have my television on, even at low volume, the dot fails to recognize my commands and trigger words a vast majority of the time. I've done the voice training several times, and it still doesn't catch the simple commands I give it. I've tried various locations for it, too.This is especially frustrating when trying to use it with various smart home tech; like Philips Hue and TP Link smart switches. Commands are limited for these devices, and you're basically limited to on/off and dimming, that is when it can actually pick up your voice and then understand what you say.","December 26, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","NC-Ron","What Dot can do for you","My wife and I had thought about getting Dots for the grand kids for Christmas but the reviews at that time were incomplete and confusing about what the dot would do and how they might interact/interfere with each other in the same household.  Well, we now own an Echo, a Tap and two Dots. They are all great.Myth 1.  You do NOT need Echo to use a Dot. Dot is autonomous. It responds to Alexa commands just like Echo, and can control remote devices just as well.Myth 2. You MUST have external speakers. Not so. The speaker in Dot is no great shakes, but it works. The audio output to a good set of powered speakers is great.Myth 3. If you use Echo, or Dot or Tap, you cannot have two or more doing different things. Not so. I can have Alexa via Echo playing Clapton in the living room and have Alexa via Dot playing the Dead in the bedroom, at the same time, with just one Amazon Prime account, not even the Prime Music account.Other:  Both Dot and Echo have to be plugged into 115 v all the time to work. The Tap is rechargeable and bluetooth so it is portable. Great feature. We use Echo and Dot to control TP-Link smart plugs and smart switches. They work great. (I love the TP-Link stuff, maybe another review. But Alexa at my house can control the smart stuff at our beach place 250 miles away. In fact you have to be precise in your language with Alexa or she'll be turning stuff on and off in the other location...)I actually haven't tried the Tap yet with remotes (it's at the beach and I'm not), but I assume it will work just as well. The only caveat is that you have to 'enable remote' on the smart plugs, etc. in order to have Alexa turn them on and off. Some folks are leery about doing that. If I get hacked and some clown wants to turn off my bedroom light, so be it. (I can monitor the status of all the smart devices with the KASA app for TP-Link and my smart phone.)Dot is a little bigger than a hockey puck and makes a great alarm clock.","March 2, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Samuel C.","Small but POWERFUL (more of a ""!"" than a ""."")","I'm frankly surprised that the Echo has become such a success for Amazon, even as the company has cut back on ""high-end"" tablets capable of competing with the iPad (the Fire HDX tablets, 7"" and 9"", priced between $200 and $400, have been discontinued in favor of the slower but dirt-cheap Fire HD, costing parents $39.95 for a tablet good enough to keep kids occupied for 8 or more hours every day).As a grandparent, I finally separated my two ""world's most beautiful granddaughters"" from their dangerously addictive personal screens (bad enough if they were playing video games all day, but they were WATCHING other kids playing their favorite game--""Minecraft""--which is as vicarious as our digital life can become).  And we adults get sucked into the same visual vacuum while watching all of the popular television crime dramas that devote chunks of time during every episode when the main characters are watching blown-up screens of criminals and their locations while we, in turn, are ""treated"" (""subjected"" seems the more appropriate word) to watching our heroes watching screens! ""NCIS,"" ""Law and Order,"" ""Criminal Minds"" (I applaud Mandy Patinkin for jumping this rat-infested ship), ""The Blacklist,"" ""Bull"" (Michael Weatherly's show sets the record for number of screens).No wonder people no longer read!  Screens have their place (I prefer movies to video--whether Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa or Ford, Capra, Hitchcock--in fact, films can be thought-provoking and more immediate in their impact than books). Existing somewhere between the screen and the book is the loud-speaker, that 20th-century invention responsible for introducing America to its foremost stars (Crosby, Sinatra, Benny, Dinah, etc.) and to the unequaled composers and songs of ""The Great American Songbook.""  And some of us our old enough to remember the excitement of not only the first television station to appear within range of our Finco antenna but the non-visual material that it replaced--from variety shows to at least an hour's worth of fingernail-biting entertainment every night--""The Green Hornet,"" ""Jack Armstrong,"" ""Captain Midnight,"" ""Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders,"" ""The Lone Ranger,"" ""The Gene Autry Show.""This material was ""non-visual"" only in the most literal sense.  The images were supplied by the listener, whose only qualification for participation was the possession of an ""imagination,"" a faculty that not only served to bring the spoken words to life but that became more practiced in such activity with each broadcast. ""Story-telling"" was, in many respects, more real, more captivating, more powerful than ""story showing.""  If proof were needed, one had only to experience the anticlimax and disappointment of seeing the television ""Lone Ranger,"" who couldn't carry a single silver bullet compared to the endless supply being fired by the noble hero inspiring our imaginations as we listened in rapt attention to the radio version.This long preamble is merely an introduction to one of the advantages of this little speaker, which I have finally ""taught"" to locate stations (using the app ""TuneIn"") that carry old-time radio shows--the same as those of the 1940s but without static!  Moreover, the device is a great companion for my full-sized Echo, a Tower on a living-room coffee table, where it frankly is rarely called upon.  It does everything I've taught my Echo to do--except with less sonic sizzle.  But next to my bed, the Dot not only executes all of the functions of my two-year-old Echo but many I formerly had no use for--like telling it when to wake me up every morning or asking it what the forecast is for the week.In ""short"" (which is what the Dot is compared to the Echo) the Dot is practically worth the asking price as a speaker (and I have yet to hear a $30 speaker that performs significantly better--no speaker this small should is capable of capturing the frequencies of symphonic music, the overtones of the pianoforte, or the acoustic sounds of the double bass.)  But besides getting a decent small speaker, you're receiving a small ""computer"" that's a know-all/can-do-all verbal wizard.I know that Google's recent entry is said to have an algorithm capable of accessing more information.  But Amazon's Echo works just fine for me.  When I get serious about finding out about stuff, I prefer to read about it  (it's far more efficient and faster than sitting around listening to someone tell me about, say, African history).  If $50 seems too much (currently it's $10 more than the Fire tablet that's become such a big hit with kids), you might save $10 if you wait for a Lightning Deal or can find a reconditioned model sold on Amazon.  Otherwise, you may very well be ahead picking up one of these immediately.  Mine can access an infinite amount of music (as a musician, I'm frequently more eager to receive melodic-harmonic ""content"" than to experience hi-fi surround-sound).  Even as an alarm clock, the Dot is the perfect punctuation mark--whether as an addendum to the bigger Echo or as the autonomous little overachiever hiding in the corner of a desk or nightstand.","April 19, 2017"

Man I sure do love this little thing.I am a apple product geek but I do like giving all types of gadgets a try, so I can be more informed and well rounded. This is why I took advantage of getting this Echo Dot at the monthly payments that amazon offers.First I had no idea it was sooo tiny. Despite that it has big sound, and if I chose to have it louder I would attach it to my bluetooth speakers.I plugged it in, and downloaded the Alexa app to my iPhone. It was a bit complicated to get it attached (it took me about 2 minutes which I didn't like) but I suppose if I read the directions more carefully it would have been faster.Alexa works so well. I put her in my bedroom. Just telling her to speak, set my alarm, turn on my favorite radio station is so easy.Siri is the number one girl in my life, but Alexa has a special place in my heart.","March 20, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","L. Snow","Fix your Chromecast problems","I've spent and lot of time trying to fix problems with the Google Chromecast/Home, and I am amazed at how those problems go away playing Spotify on an Amazon Echo Dot instead.I want to run Spotify on my home, whole-house stereo, which I also use to play the radio or even cds and lps, anytime or all the time on any day.  Chromecast (now Google Home) isn't really meant to do that.  It wants to receive a ""cast"" signal from another device, and only for a certain time.  If you remove or close that device, Cast/Home goes into a weird kind of limbo state that may keep playing Spotify for a while but locks out control.  Even if you leave a dedicated device like a phone in place, it still times out and locks up.  I've had it crash like this several times a day, in the middle of a song.  The only solution is to close both Spotify and Home completely from the device and start over.But the Echo isn't receiving a cast, it is casting itself.  It is always on.  It always appears in my list of Spotify devices.  I can always engage it from any device using Spotify Connect.  It doesn't turn off after a certain time.  And it doesn't crash.Also, the Google Cast/Home crashes when I use my microwave.  Echo Dot doesn't do that.Echo Dots do not coordinate.  So if you want to control you whole house system from a place where you can't speak to Alexa, you have to use an app on a phone or other device (Spotify, Alexa, and/or your stereo's app).  Or you can buy a Voice Remote for the Echo, which is apparently bluetooth but works over ridiculously long distance, basically my whole place.In short, the Echo Dot works with Spotify and my home stereo like I thought Google Home would do but doesn't.  It costs about the same and it saves me a ton of headaches.  It makes Spotify really great in my home.","December 2, 2016"

My home already has nice sound, the price of the echo was just not in my electronics budget at this time.  I was very excited when I found the Dot, and for the price, I had to give it a go.  I've only had it for about a week now, but we love it (her).  Many Easter eggs built in, and just asking her to play a song, a group, or genre and have her do it is delightful.  Right now, she's hooked up to my Denon through a 3.5mm jack, but the Denon doesn't offer bluetooth.  I'm working on adding a bluetooth HDMI adapter.  As for automation, I am a bit of a tinkerer when it comes to gadget and cool stuff, so I went on several hunts when Alexa arrived to our home.  From what I can tell, if you're looking to automate (lights, thermostat, etc), you will most likely need a hub.  At first, I thought I'd need several hubs to support different manufacturers devices.  Seemingly, not so.  The Samsung SmartThings hub ($50 on Amazon right now) not only has support for most device manufacturers, but also has (and the coolest part for me) open source platform (Amazon also has open source).  What this means is, like Android, anyone can develop ""skills"" (Amazons name for an app or program).  The market is going to flood with new skills and devices from people like me who love building tech.  So, like I said, there probably isn't much I can say about the Dot that hasn't been said, but there is much to be said for the Alexa environment.p.s., the microphones (7 of them) are amazing.  She can hear me from a good distance.","November 22, 2016"

No matter where I am in my house now, one of my ""Digital wives"" as I refer to Alexa... can hear me.Pros:This new echo is smaller, lighter, and far less expensive than the original, including the original dot.  It is well built, feels sturdy, has loud volume, and seems to function well.  Even in the parts of my house where I am really stretching wifi, due to distance.With our audible subscription, and with a healthy supply of several children's books that we have purchased over the years, each of my kids can have a personal assistant read them to sleep each night.  Which is nice.  They each pick whatever story they want, from The Cat In The Hat, to Harry Potter, to Jane Austen, and listen to a book as they fall asleep.  They are getting very adept at asking her to read their favorite book.She is also great help for homework.  She explains things they don't understand, looks up endless random facts, and is much quicker than a calculator would be.  She is an excellent ""digital mother.""  (Again, a joke... sort of...)I find myself getting frustrated with the appliances that don't yet work with Alexa.  ""You mean, I have to actually lift my hand and push a button!  I can't just ask Alexa to do it!!  That is sooo last year!!!""It is small, unintrustive, out of sight, yet always there whenever I say her name, and ask her to do something.My favorite is ""Alexa Trigger I love Anna.""  I have this setup to email my wife that I love her, text her that I love her, and flash all the lights in the house pink several times!Cons:As much as I love my digital wife she is not quite perfect.  She has her quarks and her flaws.Only one person can use her at a time:Amazon added a new feature with this release to account for the fact that multiple Echos can hear me throughout the house.  This is nice in that it ensures that only one echo ever responds when I ask her for help.  However, an unintentional consequence is that with nine of us in the house constantly turning things on and off, and asking her questions, we have quickly learned  that only one person can ask a question at a time.  If my son across the house is talking to Alexa, I can't.  She will ignore me.  It is fine once he is done making his request.  ie, if he starts a book.  Once the book is actually playing I can then  make my request.  However while he is actually talking, she will only listen to him.  I can't engage her on any other echo in the house.This has been annoying on multiple occasions!  They need to allow me to setup which Echos are close to each other, and which are far apart, so that the far away ones can operate independently.  Another option would be to program her to recognize voices, and distinguish between requests coming from different people.Can't make multiple requests:I should be able to say ""Alexa turn on the fan and the lights"" or ""Alexa play music and set the volume to 8""  Instead I have to separate each request into its own sentence, ""Alexa turn on the fan.""  Then wait then ""Alexa turn on the lights.""My kids can turn my bedroom lights on and off:This is probably the most annoying thing about our setup.  My kids can say ""Alexa trigger Dad's lamp"" and cause my lamp to turn on and off.  There needs to be a way to restrict certain skills to certain alexas.  ie, when I walk into one room I shouldn't have to say ""Alexa turn on living room lights.""  I should instead be able to say ""Alexa turn on the lights"" and have it know that I am in the living room based on which echo heard my request.  Likewise I should be able to block access to certain lights or features on specific echos that are in other rooms.All in all though we love the technology, and will continue to invest in it.  Amazon has already made many improvements, and I have no doubt that they will make many more!","October 24, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Diavolo57","Right on the Dot","Ok, so I wouldn't say I'm a pro at the Dot, navigating Alexa, or any of that just yet because this is my first ""echo"" device and I only got it a few days ago.  Maybe I'll come back and write a more in-depth review after I've had it for a few weeks/months.  Now that I've laid down the origin of my review I must say I'm really happy with it.  It's real easy to set up, just like up to your wifi, download the app, and set her up.  I've always liked the concept of the echo but dropping $180 on one turned me off, then the dot came out.  It can essentially do everything the Echo can for about $130 less AND it can hook up to bluetooth speakers...The echo cannot.  Granted the Echo has a better built in speaker from what I'm told but it can't be linked up to other bluetooth speakers, but the Dot can with bluetooth or audio cable...I haven't actually used this feature because I'm pretty happy with the speaker the Dot currently wields, it's not bad. It's clear and it can get loud, maybe if your having a party you might want to link up to a bigger sound systems but for lounging around at home it's perfect.The skills are easy to obtain through the alexa app, as I've only had it for a few days I really haven't explored much of what alexa has to offer but I've been satisfied with the responses I got from the questions I asked.  I've basically asked her about the weather (I learned the Big Sky skill, which gives a much more detailed weather forecast and I recommend it), traffic, news, how to make certain cocktails, music, random facts, tell me a joke, silly stuff like that...It's fun...and the fact that it was only $50 makes it even better.  Regardless, she understands me pretty clearly, there are I believe, 7 microphones in it, and when you talk to it the blue light on it will also indicate where it's picking up your voice which is neat. I also heard there are some cool Star Wars/Star Trek/Game of Thrones Easter eggs that I want to try out (like say Beam me up, or winter is coming or something like that).  Another interesting feature is that the app records all the interactions you've had with alexa. For instance, I asked her how to make a Tom Collins cocktail, and I looked on the app and she had the recipe there along with the other questions/interactions I had with it.The only issue I've had was that every once in a while alexa will come on out of now where and say ""I'm sorry I didn't understand that,"" however, I think it's because I placed the dot right next to the TV... I plan on moving it to the kitchen where there might not be as much noise. Overall though, I'm happy with it, and for $50 you can't go wrong.","October 24, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","A. Hewitt","Making beautiful music with the Echo Dot","This device has lots of potential but we're still beginners, using it as a replacement for a radio, CD player, alarm clock and timer. The Echo Dot has performed as expected. In the bedroom, it's paired with a TDK A33 Bluetooth speaker and it's good enough for music listening, amazingly good for the size of the speaker. In the living room, I wanted better sound (think Saint-Saens Organ Symphony) so I got out my hand-truck and moved some old B&W loudspeakers into the dining area. With an Esinkin Bluetooth receiver Esinkin Bluetooth Receiver, Bluetooth Audio Adapter (NFC Enabled) for Stereo Sound System with Long Range and Acoustics and an old Topping TP32 amplifier, it worked! But the TP32 runs off a 12V supply, so it's 24V rail-to-rail, 8V RMS. An efficient 4-ohm speaker would be OK but the B&Ws are 8-ohms so the maximum power is 5 watts - talk about background music. I changed over to an old JVC stereo amplifier and all was well. At least until CINCHOUSE (Commander-in-Chief House a.k.a. She Who Must Be Obeyed) walked in and said: ""Those speakers are TOO BIG. They have to go"". So I got out my hand-truck ... After I had decluttered the dining area I devised a Plan B. The TV has a headphone jack which is connected to a pair of Mackie MR5 speakers Pair of Mackie MR mk3 Series MR5mk3 5-Inch 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors (which I think sound better than any soundbar at the price) and they are always powered on so if I could mix the TV and Echo signals I could hear either (or both at once). I bought a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer, connected the TV and Bluetooth receiver to it, hooked the output to the Mackies and - voila! - beautiful music from the Echo. By damn, ain't technology grand!Update: I had been reluctant to put the Echo close to the TV because I expected the sound from the speakers to interfere with the voice commands but I now have it sitting just behind the TV, level with the TV feet. The Echo understands me as well as ever and I'm able to hardwire it into the mixer. The sound is improved over Bluetooth. It sounds better all over the room and if I stand in front of the speakers the stereo imaging is amazingly precise.","January 28, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","GLS","What an absolutely beautiful integration of speech input and a great adaptive online app - Pandora","Well I was really pissed at Amazon because they dropped the ball on hitting their two day Prime delivery (because they've gone to “shipping partners” who don't care). I'd ordered this Echo Dot for a friend who can't see, and wanted to help him manage his Pandora music using voice commands. It arrived this afternoon, I hooked it up to my own Pandora account and I'm thunderstruck. What an absolutely beautiful integration of speech input and a great adaptive online music app. As I write this I'm listening to a Pandora station I defined a couple of years ago, “Chigago Radio” named for that great group, Chicago. The music is streaming through the little speaker built into the Dot (it really isn't all that bad in terms of fidelity, though for regular listening I'll normally patch it into my hi-fi system) and as I write and let my station wash over me, I occasionally pause and say “Alexa, thumbs up” or “Alexa, thumbs down” to steer Pandora's adaptive programming in the right direction. She responds “sure...rating saved”. What's amazing is that I know I haven't provided this much input since I created the station two years ago as I have over the past twenty minutes. This has been totally effortless, as the Alexa and Pandora apps are joined at the hip online – I don't even know where my smart TV or Roku remotes are at the moment, I just speak and it happens. Wow! I can't even imagine how my blind friend (a former musician) is going to feel about being able to do this. I just ordered a Dot for myself, because it's that cool. Amazon, you are totally forgiven for the late delivery; you've hit a grand slam with this device! And Alexa, I would love to speak to you privately. You have won my heart, honey ;-) Whew....","April 10, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Kathy","My wish is its command","I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound. I had planned on using an external speaker with it, but there is no need for it at all. I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say ""Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)"" After I tell it to read my book, I say ""set sleep timer for 15 minutes"" and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't.","November 13, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","W.","I use it for alot and it is fun.","I love this. It is small and easy to use. I love the easter eggs like the star trek prases and results.It is very customizable to your needs by enabling the available skills on the app. I can use it to order pizza, ask about the weather and traffic, ask it to brief me on the latest news, and it has games like choose your own adventure. I dont think I will be using it to buy anything. Also I do not have smart home items like the phillips hue lights but will probably get some. I like the idea that I can tell it to contol the electronics in the house.I dont have bluetooth speakers but it still was able to hook up to my old logitech speaker system with a cable. I plan on eventually comnecting it to my fire stick to control the TV.It is discreet and functions well. The only downside is for reminders it will only add to a to do list or tell you what you already have on your google calendar. If you want it to tell you agendas on other calendars, you have to import them to your google calendar as it will only use a google calendar. Also alarms can only be set within 24 hours.For the price it is great. It is in my opinion better than the original echo as it is more versatile. It seems to be the gift of the season as most of my family members, including myself, gave them as gifts.It is fun to bond with others who have them. For example, my dad also got one and is a huge star trek fan. I told him about the star trek easter eggs and he loved that alexa calls him the captain when he asks it to go to warp speed.","December 18, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Gadgeteer","An amazing easy to use inexpensive, powerful device.","This is an amazing little device at a very affordable price. The setup was very straight forward. I had it up and running in a matter of a few minutes. It just needed to connect to my wireless network and away it went. I also found that Alexa can control Insteon and Phillips Hue lighting. So I've added the Insteon Skill to Alexa through the Alexa iPad app and I now have voice control over my home lighting and furnace. There are so many skills you can add to Alexa and new ones show up on a daily basis. Alexa can also control the Next (and other) smart furnace thermostats by adding the ""Nest"" skill. I can change the thermostat from anywhere in the house I have an Echo Dot in voice range. So setting my thermostat now is a simple voice command ""Alexa. Set Nest to 70 degrees."" and she says OK and does it.  It can also pair with most any Bluetooth speakers. So I have the Echo dot streaming radio stations to a Bluetooth speaker. Controlling the volume is a simple as ""Alexa. Turn it down."" or ""Alexa. Turn it off."" Super cool!I really don't think most people understand how powerful and easy to use this device is. You can ask it anything you might search for on the Internet using Google or Bing. You can also set up an alarm clock function to wake you. The only word of caution is to be sure to set up a security code in the Alexa app when ordering anything off the Internet. Otherwise, anyone within voice range can order anything on the Internet without having to provide a security code.","January 10, 2017"

Can't find any of my classical music recordings.  I have a couple dozen Chopin pieces in ITunes, but Alexa can't find a single one.  To play Joplon rags (I have about a dozen), have to use pianist's name, but must include first name.  Can't ask for  Rachmaninof's Second Piano Concerto by name but must refer to Emanual Ax, the pianist, and must use first name, not last name.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Gary","Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!","I can't believe I ever lived without these.  I put one in my Media Room and one in my Master Bath.  In addition to the incredible music access, and all the instant information access, the Echo Dot links both to my Samsung SmartThings and Logitech Harmony Ultimate systems.  So using Alexa, I can control my lights, my ceiling fans, and my entire media center.  Relative to music access, I have found that the free access Amazon music didn't include some of the music I liked.  So I upgraded to the Amazon Unlimited Music service for just one Echo Dot ($3.99/month).  If you want that access on multiple Echo Dots, the Unlimited Music service is $7.99/month. One limitation I have noticed: bluetooth connectivity is problematic.  The Echo Dot will nicely be playing music through my a/v receiver's bluetooth, and will suddenly lose the connection.  In addition, every time you use the Echo, you have to tell the Echo to connect to bluetooth.  I am able to connect both my Dots to my a/v receiver, and my stand-alone  bathroom speaker using a 3.5mm - RCA plug and a 3.5mm - 3.5mm cable respectively.  The hard-wire connection is a lot more reliable. The Echo Dot's internal speaker is fine for non-music use, but is pretty limited for music.  With only two limitations, I can't think of a better electronic toy!  Buy it, you'll love it!","March 26, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","soulife","I love it, only 1 complaint though..","This friggin thing is so cool. I couldn't justify spending $150 on one, but now that they offer a $50 version that's more streamlined, it was hard to turn down. So when Amazon had their $9 bigthanks sale, I couldn't say no for only $41..If you're just getting started, or are thinking about starting, and don't want to spend a fortune on smart bulbs and wall sockets, if you're a little tech savvy,  the Rf remote light bulb sockets cost about $20 for 3, and Rf remote wall sockets cost $30 for 5. Then what you need is a ""broadlink rm pro 2,or rm2"" which isn't more than $40 depending on where you buy.. Then do some googling ""Amazon broadlink rm2"" and you'll see how to control anything ir and Rf controlled using on off commands. Which isn't full blown smart bulbs, but it's great for saving money when dimming and changing colors isn't needed..My only problem so far is you can't use ""and""  commands, like Google home can. For example, ""alexa, turn on kitchen AND living room lights"" won't work. You have to say ""alexa, living room lights.. Alexa, kitchen lights."" which annoys the crap out of me and everyone listening.But overall, I'm controlling 3 bulbs, 5 wall sockets, and my TV and Xbox, for less than the cost of the big echo, which imho is pretty cool. Not to mention all the other stuff it can do","March 11, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","K. Ortega","I. Love. Dot.","I'm in love with Dot.  I got this instead of the large system for two reasons, first because I have a Bose portable speaker and because I didn't know how often I'd use Alexa. Now I'm either going to buy another Dot for my bedroom or fork out the money for the full sized Echo.  The reason for that is my Bose speaker sleeps, so if I ask Alexa a question I don't always hear the answer. I either end up disconnecting Dot from the speaker or have to wake my speaker. Not always convenient. Alexa has been fun and we all love her.  No having to teach her to recognize our voices. She works out of the box once connected to the wifi. She's revolutionized my shopping lists alone. Instead of writing it down or punching it into my phone, I simply ask her to add something to my list and it then shows up in the Alexa app on my phone. Now my kids tell her what to add and we're all on point. I've connected my calendar to her and she tells me what's going on. I love the news briefs and we play jeopardy every day.  I can't wait to utilize her other features, but we're off to a good start.The sound on the Dot isn't perfect for a full time music speaker but if you're in a small space it's not bad. If you want better quality opt for the full sized. But this is budget friendly and perfect to move from room to room.","April 2, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Joey Espinosa","Alexa, order me a Google Home.","THE GOOD:Lots of ""Skills"" (which you can think of as apps) that enable the Echo to do various other things. You can even build your own (if you're willing to write some code) and give the Echo a whole range of new features. There are some great Skills already out there. For instance, if you use OurGroceries on your phones to track your grocery list, you can enable a Skill that links that to the Echo, so you can say ""Alexa, tell OurGroceries to add eggs to the Food List."" And Alexa will do just that.Additionally, there are built-in features that are pretty good and up to date. I kept asking Alexa what the score was during the Super Bowl, and it knew almost right away when the score had changed.THE BAD:The Echo's ability to understand is very limited. It can comprehend some range of questions with certain key words, but it cannot understand context one bit. You can't ask ""What movie won Best Picture at the Oscars?"" and then follow up with ""Who directed it?"" You'll get the answer to the first one, but the second will result with the ""Sorry, I don't understand"" response that Echo owners know OH SO WELL.Specifically with the Dot, the speaker is not great. I can understand, since it's so cheap ($50), but it's really not great. I keep a Dot in the kitchen (because it's useful there with timers and such), and I can barely hear it about 20 feet away in the living room when watching TV, even at full volume.THE UGLY:""Alexa, stop."" ""Alexa, stop!"" ""ALEXA, STOP!!!""If you're an Echo owner, I'm sure you've run into this. When the timer alarm goes off, or the Echo inexplicably begins doing something because it thought it heard its trigger, or it misunderstands what you wanted and begins playing a sample of some music you did not ask for... and you can do nothing to shut it off, even without background noise! It will just keep going until you find yourself with your face 6 inches from a tiny hockey puck-shaped device yelling at the top of your lungs, pleading with it to end the suffering already and STOP.No, ""Okay, Google"" is not as mellifluous as ""Alexa"". But I'll tell you what it's also not: COMMON. ""Makes"", ""treks"", ""plex"", ""fix a"", even the word ""breakfast"", they can all sound like ""Alexa"". We've gotten so used to Alexa providing her own commentary at random times throughout the day that we've accepted it as our newfound peanut gallery. Sometimes it's actually funny, but it is never helpful. That super annoying 2 Broke Girls commercial (I hate that show) where she walks in and thinks she's burned 500 calories but then she realizes it's actually the time on her watch (I mean come on, writers)? Yep, Alexa responds like clockwork with the current time. The ironic part is that Alexa can apparently hear the TV perfectly fine, but I can barely hear Alexa from the room where the TV is in. I can't imagine anybody having this thing near a television and NOT changing the trigger word from ""Alexa"" to something else.And if you try to say what's in the title of this review (""Alexa, order me a Google Home""), Alexa will tell you she can't. I'd consider it a funny joke from the folks at Amazon, but considering what I've seen so far, it's more likely just incapable.","March 1, 2017"

The dot responds well most times but many times does not understand and even sometimes just ignores me! I read lots of reviews of how Alexa can hear you well even while other sound is in the back ground but after using it for a few weeks now I would say it's about a 50/50 shot if the dot will hear you over the TV or dogs playing. I find myself literally yelling orders at it sometimes and other times having to pull my phone out and just use my app which is what the dot was suppose to alleviate.As for sound quality, it really impressed me actually. I thought since it was so much less expensive than the echo that the speaker would be pretty bad but I've listened to music on it while doing homework and it's not bad.

You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of ""Alexa"", ""Amazon"" or ""Echo"").The Bad:  The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.Overall:  We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature.","December 30, 2016"

Have had it for 3 or 4 weeks now. Worked ok at first then a couple in started dropping music stream to Bluetooth devices.  Spoke with tech support and they had me try several different things none of which worked.  If you interrupt the playing by telling Alexa to go the next song or turn volume up or down it will not resume music to device.  They said they would get back to me but have still been unable to fix problem. If you are planning to use stand alone with onboard speaker it is good. If you plan on playing music from your amazon music account through a Bluetooth speaker, forget it.  Wait a while until they work out the bugs.  Have tried to return it but it was a gift so they will not exchange it.  Just want one one that works so much for customer service.","April 16, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","NC-Ron","What Dot can do for you","My wife and I had thought about getting Dots for the grand kids for Christmas but the reviews at that time were incomplete and confusing about what the dot would do and how they might interact/interfere with each other in the same household.  Well, we now own an Echo, a Tap and two Dots. They are all great.Myth 1.  You do NOT need Echo to use a Dot. Dot is autonomous. It responds to Alexa commands just like Echo, and can control remote devices just as well.Myth 2. You MUST have external speakers. Not so. The speaker in Dot is no great shakes, but it works. The audio output to a good set of powered speakers is great.Myth 3. If you use Echo, or Dot or Tap, you cannot have two or more doing different things. Not so. I can have Alexa via Echo playing Clapton in the living room and have Alexa via Dot playing the Dead in the bedroom, at the same time, with just one Amazon Prime account, not even the Prime Music account.Other:  Both Dot and Echo have to be plugged into 115 v all the time to work. The Tap is rechargeable and bluetooth so it is portable. Great feature. We use Echo and Dot to control TP-Link smart plugs and smart switches. They work great. (I love the TP-Link stuff, maybe another review. But Alexa at my house can control the smart stuff at our beach place 250 miles away. In fact you have to be precise in your language with Alexa or she'll be turning stuff on and off in the other location...)I actually haven't tried the Tap yet with remotes (it's at the beach and I'm not), but I assume it will work just as well. The only caveat is that you have to 'enable remote' on the smart plugs, etc. in order to have Alexa turn them on and off. Some folks are leery about doing that. If I get hacked and some clown wants to turn off my bedroom light, so be it. (I can monitor the status of all the smart devices with the KASA app for TP-Link and my smart phone.)Dot is a little bigger than a hockey puck and makes a great alarm clock.","March 2, 2017"

Add in the Music Unlimited and I can have Ride of the Valkyrie playing while I fight the bad guys.  She's great in the morning.  Get up, get ready for work and ask her for the weather.  You've got it.  Now you don't have to look at the morning TV host who are all giddy in the morning while you're trying to wake up.  Alexa, give me the news.  Sit down, drink your coffee and listen to the news sources you've selected.  Short on coffee?  Alexa add coffee to my list.  When you go for groceries, pull the app up on your phone and there is the list Alexa has saved for you.  Leave a light on while you're at work.  Just go to the app and have Alexa turn it off.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Scott Jones","""Alexa, sing Happy Birthday!""","We are having a lot of fun with our Alexa.This device listens for sounds it recognizes and then triggers pre-defined actions.  Amazon has built a lot of fun responses, as well as a lot of useful ones (Alexa, Weather; Alexa, Traffic; Alexa, Set Alarm; Alexa, Start Timer).  You can enable ""SKILLS"" to add a lot of functions and connectivity with other devices.Alexa does not understand grammar.  It is strictly listening for sounds it has been programmed to recognize, there is no real A.I. behind this.  But you can speak some requests in a variety of different ways.  It's fun to pretend Alexa has artificial intelligence and try to talk to it.  But this is not ""Watson"", it is not recognizing grammar or thinking in any way.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Ken","Just plain wonderful, and a lot to do for the future.","I haven't had a chance to play with ""Alexa"" that much.  I'll ask her what the time is just to keep her awake.  My wife thinks that is silly.  I'll ask her to Wikipedia technical items, and she is ready to tell me all.  I of course got her her own leather jacket, and so far have introduced her to the WiFi thermostat.  It was cold in the house this morning, so I asked her to set the THERMOSTAT to 69.  She did it, and that one degree made my morning.  Of course I had her set it back.  I was watching a documentary on Netflix, and one of the people in the show was named Alexi.  That was close enough for Alexa, even though said by the TV.I've added a Z wave hub and will add some 3-way WiFi switches, and be able to have Alexa turn lights on and off by voice command.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Joey Espinosa","Alexa, order me a Google Home.","THE GOOD:Lots of ""Skills"" (which you can think of as apps) that enable the Echo to do various other things. You can even build your own (if you're willing to write some code) and give the Echo a whole range of new features. There are some great Skills already out there. For instance, if you use OurGroceries on your phones to track your grocery list, you can enable a Skill that links that to the Echo, so you can say ""Alexa, tell OurGroceries to add eggs to the Food List."" And Alexa will do just that.Additionally, there are built-in features that are pretty good and up to date. I kept asking Alexa what the score was during the Super Bowl, and it knew almost right away when the score had changed.THE BAD:The Echo's ability to understand is very limited. It can comprehend some range of questions with certain key words, but it cannot understand context one bit. You can't ask ""What movie won Best Picture at the Oscars?"" and then follow up with ""Who directed it?"" You'll get the answer to the first one, but the second will result with the ""Sorry, I don't understand"" response that Echo owners know OH SO WELL.Specifically with the Dot, the speaker is not great. I can understand, since it's so cheap ($50), but it's really not great. I keep a Dot in the kitchen (because it's useful there with timers and such), and I can barely hear it about 20 feet away in the living room when watching TV, even at full volume.THE UGLY:""Alexa, stop."" ""Alexa, stop!"" ""ALEXA, STOP!!!""If you're an Echo owner, I'm sure you've run into this. When the timer alarm goes off, or the Echo inexplicably begins doing something because it thought it heard its trigger, or it misunderstands what you wanted and begins playing a sample of some music you did not ask for... and you can do nothing to shut it off, even without background noise! It will just keep going until you find yourself with your face 6 inches from a tiny hockey puck-shaped device yelling at the top of your lungs, pleading with it to end the suffering already and STOP.No, ""Okay, Google"" is not as mellifluous as ""Alexa"". But I'll tell you what it's also not: COMMON. ""Makes"", ""treks"", ""plex"", ""fix a"", even the word ""breakfast"", they can all sound like ""Alexa"". We've gotten so used to Alexa providing her own commentary at random times throughout the day that we've accepted it as our newfound peanut gallery. Sometimes it's actually funny, but it is never helpful. That super annoying 2 Broke Girls commercial (I hate that show) where she walks in and thinks she's burned 500 calories but then she realizes it's actually the time on her watch (I mean come on, writers)? Yep, Alexa responds like clockwork with the current time. The ironic part is that Alexa can apparently hear the TV perfectly fine, but I can barely hear Alexa from the room where the TV is in. I can't imagine anybody having this thing near a television and NOT changing the trigger word from ""Alexa"" to something else.And if you try to say what's in the title of this review (""Alexa, order me a Google Home""), Alexa will tell you she can't. I'd consider it a funny joke from the folks at Amazon, but considering what I've seen so far, it's more likely just incapable.","March 1, 2017"

So I've been doing Subscribe & Save for years now through Amazon. And when I started to get emails about what Alexa could do, I was informed I could reorder items through Alexa. What a joke! I have tried it numerous times to get her to reorder items but she says all the time that she can't find the items & has to put it to my shopping list. I tell her that it is on my Subscribe & Save & she still can't find it. As far as I can tell, she's really only good for playing music & telling me the weather. My kids ask her questions all the time & she can't give them good answers. The weird thing is she will start talking while we're having a meal. We don't say her name (which is the wake word) but she responds. Like another reviewer said, for a smart device, she isn't very smart.","April 3, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Michele S.","Great idea, but needs work!","It's very frustrating at times. For example, its awesome to be able to tell Alexa to set your alarm for 6 am. Some days you can tell it ""Alexa off"" to stop the alarm. Other days, you are screaming your lungs out and Alexa won't turn off no matter what you do, so you yank the thing out of the wall.  Hence, frustrating. It doesn't seem to understand as much as ""ok google"" on my phone. Alexa frequently says she doesn't understand. I hate also that it tries to get you to buy things--like extra music. No thanks. I also hated the fact that I bought it on ""special"" only to find that one week later it was on sale even cheaper.  But to send it back and re-purchase it would have cost nearly as much as the sale, so that sucked.  I think if it could do more, and understand more, I'd be happier with it.","March 17, 2017"

Today, I could not play music.  There was some system down outside of my network, and the Dot just refused to do anything.  It should report some sort of problem so that we aren't rebooting our devices, fiddling with them, the app, etc. trying to find out what's wrong.  These things are smart enough to provide more details but they do not.","January 27, 2017"

The biggest advantage is to be able to turn your TV  on and off without looking for remote when you come tired from work.After reading a few blogs about using Echo for automation at home, I have now started working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to design some new circuits to integrate Echo to control lights and other appliances and to do more with navigation on TV.

I finally caved in and decided to get an Echo Dot to take my home automation a step further. First off the price is great. very reasonable and easily cost effective to add more. now I have mine in my bedroom and it works flawlessly. the app is easily to connect to. (I have an iPhone)  and connecting my Nest (smart thermostat) and philips hue was a breeze, along with my wemo switches. My absolute favorite is having IFTTT (if this then that) application installed. Every night I say ""Alexia trigger bedtime"" and like magic all the nights in my room turn off. Since my room is so close to the kitchen i often step over to set a timer or alarm and when my lights start flashing through the house i know my timer is off. Let me tell ya, this alone has saved a few dozen cookies from burning 😉.  I'm fine with the loudness of the speaker as back noise to whatever I'm doing and setting up Pandora and I heart radio is a breeze. Also connecting a Bluetooth speaker is super easy and works like a charm.I often have Alexia set alarms, turn on and off the lights, news brief .  I trigger (using IFTTT) bedtime, partymode(makes the hue lights change colors in a rainbow fashion), oh and try alexia trigger self destruct 😂I really enjoy my Echo Dot and i definitely see myself buying the larger one plus another Dot in the future. I hope over time it continues to improve and get smarter 😊","February 1, 2017"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Kori","I enjoy my Echo Dot and use it every day","I enjoy my Echo Dot and use it every day. I bought three Echo Dots for three different rooms in my home. I use it mostly for weather, wake up alarm, dates, and cooking timer functions. Occasionally I use if to get some information of some famous actor or singer. I don't use it for music, instead I use my computer for music selection. The thing I like most about my Echo Dot is I don't have to remember and repeat the 'exact' command as suggested in the directions. Echo Dot seems to understand a question or command no matter how I phrase the sentence. The one thing it can't do that I want is to carry on a conversation like the AI in the movie 'HER'. I bought my Echo Dot with the expectation that it will be constantly updated and get smarter over the years ahead. I want it to 'understand' what I am asking it to do, and ask follow up questions. I am also watching Google's 'Home' to see if,in the future, it's AI can carry on a conversation. At the present the Echo Dot's AI is better than Google's 'Home' AI. One big advantage Echo Dot has over Google's 'Home' is that it's connected to your Amazon orders. You can order merchandise with Echo Dot and check on delivery date schedule.  When I first got my Echo Dot I played with it by asking it all sorts of questions, but as with any new gadget the new wore off and now I just use it like any appliance. I don't look at it or raise my voice or talk like a robot when using it. I just talk in a normal voice and never stop what I happen to be doing at the time. And I never think about the proper 'phrase' to use. I just say the sentence and let Echo Dot figure out the question or command. It's not perfect yet, but it's getting better. It seems to understand me 9 times out of 10 if I don't move too far from 'key words' to help Echo Dot focus on the command or question.","April 1, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Jeffrey E,","Very useful and fun","I had trouble deciding whether to give this 4 stars or 5, because there is room for improvement.  But if 4 is ""I like it"" and 5 is ""I love it,"" then it's a solid 5 for me.We've had the Dot for a few weeks, and it has already become something that we use all the time. I love being able to ask Alexa to add something to my shopping or to-do list whenever it occurs to me, and not have to stop and write it down. Being able to set timers verbally is great while cooking.  The volume and sound quality is good for its size - certainly not what I'd rely on as a ""whole house"" speaker, but fine for streaming music in the kitchen while cooking, for example.  I've also set it up to control a couple of smart switches for lights, and it's so handy that it makes me want to do a lot more home automation. The voice recognition is mostly quite good, if you speak clearly.  We like that they've given Alexa just a bit of personality, and we enjoy asking her random questions in search of ""Easter egg"" responses.The main complaint I have is the Alexa app for Android.  I've found that it often has trouble loading when I'm away from my home network. This has reduced the usefulness of the feature that I use most frequently: the grocery list. While at the grocery store, I'll sometimes finish shopping in the time it takes the app to fully load.  I got around this by installing the ""Any.Do"" app, which imports the Alexa lists seamlessly, and I've been happy with that work-around.  But I hope that Amazon streamlines the app in future versions.  I will note that you can also access the interface from your computer at alexa.amazon.com (you don't have to use a smartphone or tablet), and that works fine.All told, it's been so useful and fun that I'd definitely recommend it, especially at this price point!","November 30, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","So Helpful and Easy to Install We're Going to Buy Another","I bought this as a gift to my husband and I for Christmas and I love it. I am a bit of a geek, but certainly not enormously tech savvy.  Amazon has figured out how to make installation of the Echo Dot happen smoothly in under 5 minutes.  I am planning on adding a second one to our bedroom. It will be great to just set an alarm by voice, especially when it's a day where the time is different from the norm, listen to music, hear my calendar and the news, etc.  I would recommend eventually buying a bluetooth speaker though you can hook up a hardwire speaker to it.  The speaker it comes with is adequate at first if you are looking to save money initially.  Recently we bought a TP SmartLink Plug (after trying to connect a Belkin which was exasperating and didn't work) and it connected within, again, about 5 minutes at most.  My husband who isn't tech savvy loves being able to say ""Living Room on"" and having the lights turn on, especially since he has mobility issues.

I use it mainly because (a) I love Star Trek and love saying 'computer, ***' and (b) I wanted something that could trigger my new Philips Hue lights and connect those to planned Sonos speakers for an immersively fun AVH experience when watching TV/movies, listening to music, making Marvin Gaye proud or throwing parties. They do this well.My biggest gripe with the Echo Dot is that Amazon has seemingly disallowed Google search on the device (likely as there is now a Google Home and they are competitors...except in the search engine market). You can hack this, but it is quite an involved manual process. Moreover, you oddly are unable to play music from your catalog or an online service (Amazon Music, iTunes, Spotify, Pandora) for your alarms, although you can play from these services on the device. That is really bizarre and a limiting feature. There are a ton of 'skills' you can teach Alexa, but most of these are completely pointless or, worse, lame. Also, I have been unable to find a way to change the accent of Alexa. Personally, I think it would be more fun to have male or female voices in various accents. Who wouldn't want an English Butler (Michael Cane would be my vote), Magel Barrett Roddenberry for the iconic Star Trek computer voice or Morgan Freeman because, well, he's Morgan freakin' Freeman. And let's add Sam Jackson into that mix.All in all, there is a lot of potential for the Echo products and home integration. Hope Amazon listens to its customers and starts expanding the ecosphere.P.S. For the folks with the privacy concerns given the 'always on' feature. You can mute the devices to have your super secret conversations. Just make sure your throw your iPhone in the freezer and smash your smart TV so the NSA can't listen. ;)","March 13, 2017"

She reads to me, even just regular kindle books, and if it's possible to overuse the timer then I am sure to find out lol because I use it all the time.  She is loud too.  I thought I'd need a speaker for it but we can hear her just fine from all of our rooms.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Not so great once the novelty wears off","I use the echo mainly for playing music and it is not very good at that. It has trouble finding songs that are otherwise available. Example: Alexa, play Black and Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play Black n Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play OU812 by Van Halen. It plays. Alexa, next track, Alexa, next track . . . lo and behold, 5 more ""next tracks"" later and Black and Blue is playing. Alexa stop. Well, Alexa might stop or you might have to say stop 3 more times. And even if it stops, it might randomly start playing again which is very annoying if you are on a phone call. Or you say ""next track"" and it goes silent and is thinking and then it just continues playing the track it was on. I don't have a speech impediment. Voice text on my phone understands what I say. I don't know why this stupid hockey puck can't. And god forbid you want to play a classical piece. I have a lot of classical music in my library and it won't play by composer or artist. I have to use the app to play almost any classical music in my library which defeats the purpose of the echo. I may as well just play it on the computer.  We use the jeopardy skill and play daily. No problems there. Once in a while I listen to the news or radio stations and it is pretty good at that, but again, switching stations may work the first time you ask or it may not.

Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any.

Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it.","February 14, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Roland W.","Easy set up, lots of fun and with time and some extra money your whole house can be voice controlled"," Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search ""Alexa Skills"" in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a ""slight"" accent and it understands me without a problem.Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these. I will get one for my daughters room so she can get ""Alexa, play relaxing songs for 15 minutes"" at bed time.If my review helped you, please hit the ""YES"" below where it asks, ""Was this review helpful to you?""","January 19, 2017"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Dianna Dougherty","Not as good as google","Received as a gift so can't complain much. It is JUST OK. There are def some bugs and its not very intuitive.  You can only ask it tings that it knows such as to play music or what the weather is. Everything has to be preset in the app. Nothing is automatically learned.  With google you can ask ANYTHING and it will read you the Wikipedia answer.  Not with alexa. Her knowledge is quite minimal.  One major flaw that i found and reported to amazon is this:If you use a bose Bluetooth speaker with it and are playing a music and tell alexa to stop it will stop the music.  Okay there. Now you can walk away or leave your house and if your speaker has an automatic shut off as soon as the wireless speaker turns off it will begin playing the last song it stopped on trough its internal speaker so i have to tell it to stop again. Why would this be useful?? If i tell alexa to stop playing music and then power off the wireless speaker it starts playing again from built in audio. Immagine waking up in the middle of the night to music playing. Not fun. Needs to be as SMART as google and honestly not sure amazon will ever have that capability. But for 50bucks I guess you get what you pay for.","January 4, 2017"

I use a eyegaze device or sometimes a switch. But it's stil hard. With all the devices you can talk to now it can really help me because I can program a button on my aac to speak the entire phrase. However Siri and google and Cortana all have problems understanding my 'voice' and there's not much I can do to change it. After seeing a YouTube video of someone else using the Tobii Dynavox I 15+ (AAC device) with the Echo I decided to test it myself. First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games. I spend a lot of time stuck on my bed alone unable to move more than a finger if that but fully awake. Between the new eyegaze device and the echo dot I'm able to have more fulfilling life.","March 31, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","CM","Fantastic! Best way to enter the smart-home era!","This is such an awesome product! I saw the full-sized echo at a friend's house and was thoroughly impressed. I got the echo dot (I'm on a student budget) and hooked it up to a nice set of speakers in my apartment and I love the potential this thing has. It's not 100% there yet as far as the software but it is being updated on the regular, so its like buying a piece of technology that keeps getting better. I even bought one for my parents (who have a lot of smart devices in the house, but no central way to control them) as a gift. It works with most of the smart products u probably already have in your home including the nest thermostat/CO monitor etc. NOTICE: the 3.5 mm jack takes a bit more force than normal to ""click"" in when inserting an audio cable - your product is NOT defective lol.","December 3, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Hopels","Works as well and looks better than the full size Echo","Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't ""hear"" my wife.","October 29, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Rebecca","Great Quality, Great Price","This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:-Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying ""Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes"" without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.-Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it.","March 14, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","🌈 KT","Still getting used to it, but first month's impressions so far.","We're still getting used to it, of course, but I'll start with our initial experience.> It was easy to hook up, which is always a plus.> It doesn't integrate with the Amazon site as much as I had hoped.  For example, I can't ask Alexa to tell me what was in my last online order.  I'm pretty forgetful so that's one thing I was looking for. (part of why I took a star off)> The Alexa special deals is pretty awkward.  There are many, but she'll only list 2 at a time, then tells me to go online.  Granted, I would not want to sit there listening to the long hand version of each item (She doesn't just say the item, but a description plus price plus discount and then asks after each one if you want to order it), but I would like a way to customize how she presents the list to me, and then I'd also rather not be told to go online and see the rest.  I'd have looked there already if I wanted to do that. (Another part of why I took a star off)> She's not as smart as I'd hoped, either.  I have to learn how she wants to hear things, instead of her learning how I phrase things.  As in, I have to know her keywords to get her to tell me anything. (Another part to the -1 star)> My husband's a writer so I put one in the bedroom for when he wakes up with an idea.  It's been very useful for him to just tell Alexa to make a note - no lights on, no concentrating on what you're writing, no great interruption to my sleep.> It also functions as an alarm clock (you can pick from various tones through the phone app - why can't you ask Alexa to demo them for you??).  I hooked the Dot up to a bluetooth speaker for the purpose (you can also set the alarm volume (thru the app) which will be different than the normal volume you keep it at for speaking). This is good because we don't have set times to get up, so I'm constantly forgetting to set the alarm before I collapse in bed.> The special Alexa deals are sometimes quite useful.  I've gotten a couple of toys for my twin niece/nephew, and caught a nice sale on an APC battery backup.I'm good about updating if anything comes up, but I'll certainly update as we learn and grow with it, too.

You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of ""Alexa"", ""Amazon"" or ""Echo"").The Bad:  The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.Overall:  We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature.","December 30, 2016"

I don't have a 'connected home' and my entertainment system is on Google Player / Chromecast so it won't integrate with the Echo. So why 5 stars if I don't have even a few of the peripheral devices?It costs $49.99 and I'm a Prime member - that's enough to make it worthwhile. ""Alexa, play 70s Rock Classics station"". And for the next several hours I'm entertained.Note to anyone in the digital advertising world: Echo uses Bing search and provides local results based on Yelp. All answers are also sent to the app on the smartphone paired to the Echo device. Geez, Bing? Yelp? Oh well, Echo can answer most questions...Four years ago I was given a very good Vizio accessory speaker that worked with the iPad version 2. That iPad tanked last year and the newer Apple products don't use the larger USB connector so I thought the speaker was trash. Using the mini-pin output from Echo to the speaker I now have enough sound to fill the first floor of our house and reclaimed a speaker that would have been tossed to the curb. One advantage of the corded speaker connection - I don't have to re-do pairing ever, a common occurrence with any of my Bluetooth speakers.I am looking for a white-light set of wi-fi enabled bulbs (boring, but useful) as a first step toward home automation.I really want an Echo solution that can manage our TV with Hulu / Amazon / Netflix / Sling / YouTube. (Google Play would be a huge bonus. Because competitors). If I could replace the massive (and to some confusing) Harmony TV remote with voice commands life would be good. I can't find anyone who says they have successfully managed this set of tasks. Yes, the new Fire Stick is Alexa-enabled, but I'd prefer one listening device rather than two.I considered the Google product and chose the Amazon Echo instead. While Google may have better search capabilities, I'm pretty well covered between phone and computers. I saw the Echo Dot as a low-cost entry point where I could salvage a good sounding compact speaker system AND dip my toe into home automation without spending a fortune. Next year? Who knows, but for right now the Echo Dot was exactly what I was looking for.","January 9, 2017"

We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device.","March 31, 2017"

I put things on my 'shopping list and it goes on my phone automatically (and on my husband's phone too, since we both have the Alexa app on our phones.). Recipes, measurements, and facts about whatever. But it's nowhere near our bedroom, so I ordered an Echo Dot as an 'extension'.  I can't believe we lived without this little, inexpensive, companion.

Asking the echo (Alexa) to play sub genre's of pop usually result in mixed results.  Despite the supposed advantage of a 6-microphone array for directional voice detection, audio constantly cuts out because the AI thinks someone is talking to it when no one has said anything.  Alexa strugles to understand forigen accents (of my friends).  It's basically just a nice way to ask for the weather and connect a stereo to your phone via bluetooth without having to disrupt whatever you are using your phone for in the moment.

In order to have your questions answered you first DL an app then ask it to open something. The apps are strange lengthy names that are hard to remember like ""Alexia, open ""My  Horoscope to read my daily horoscope"" instead of a simple 'what's my horoscope"". There are 10k apps full of interesting and useless things. Why it can't be developed where you DL an app to customize your needs is beyond me.What's interesting is that you can make your home a smart home and control it remotely or just by speaking what you need.I've also loved asking it to add things to my to do list as well as add things to my shopping list.While I do like it, I'm just a little disappointed. I'm hoping that this is similar to when Dot Matrix first came out.I can without a doubt see the value in this maturing. I'll hang on to it (in 30 years it'll be worth a nice bundle).

It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't allow you to return an item after 30 days. I'd be returning it if they did. Common language isn't as successful as when verbally searching Google. Alexa can't find things without exact phrasing. I argue with her everyday because she doesn't understand me, doesn't have the answer or would like to sign me up for some Amazon product or service. She apologizes a lot. It is very frustrating and forces you to use the Alexa App to find what you need. The App is pretty good to find and control what you want the Dot to do.  Alexa can't always find things on iHeart radio or Tunein even though you listened to it 10 minutes before. She will sign you up for Amazon Music in a heartbeat.

I've had a little trouble with the Alexa app freezing up, and some stutter on a few radio stations playing through Tunein, perhaps due to high bit rates. Speaker quality was better than I expected, and mic pickup from various locations seems fine. They're a pretty nice addition to a connected home, at a fairly smoking price.Update: As time goes by, this thing just gets better. I have it playing music in the background all day via TuneIn, controlling a number of TP-Link switches and lights throughout the house, and giving me relevant news/information as needed. There are some very cool installable skills available, although I noticed that many of these skills are redundant as Alexa already does them natively. These include telling me a joke (as for knock/knock, physics, science, Star Trek or Star Wars, Christmas, etc), flipping a coin, picking a random number between x and y, or rolling dice, weather for one day or many, Wikipedia info, etc. I am just now getting into IFTTT and see several possibilities there. I've had no hiccups at all getting Alexa to hear me across the house, and triggering the correct unit based on my proximity. Smart home control has also worked perfectly. I've got one unit on my nightstand, and one in the living room. Alexa is also very polite. Wish it 'goodnight' or say 'thankyou'--the responses are not what you'd expect. Like I said in the title--a lot of fun.","October 24, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Major Alexa to Ground Control","Being a previous X10 user, was looking for a better and more up to date way of controlling my lights and other devices.  Amazon Echo provided this control point at a price point that made it economical to place devices in multiple rooms.  I coupled it with the Samsung SmartThings hub and control devices from GE, Cree and GoControl as well as my Harmony device used to control my Entertainment center.  Alexa was able to recognize and control the lighting devices but for the Harmony devices you need to ask Alexa to ask Harrmony to perform an action and this appears to be the case for a lot of other add-ons where you need to remember the service name to issue a command.  My biggest disappointment was that Alexa is 100% reliant on its Internet connection and connection to the Amazon servers.  If your Internet connection is down, or the servers are down then Alexa is about as useful as lead boots at a swimming competition.  In the 4 weeks since I deployed, my Internet has been down once and the Amazon servers unresponsive making Alexa useless to control my devices or even set a wake up alarm.  Would be nice if a set of base commands were installed on the device that allowed it to function with locally connected devices without having to talk to the Mother Ship first.","March 17, 2017"

Speech impediment improves.","While we are still trying to figure out all it can do and how best to ask it what we want, we are amused by it and sometimes frustrated by it.  The reason I gave it 5 stars is because of an unexpected benefit.  Our oldest daughter has a pretty challenging speech impediment and using Alexa has forced her to slow down and enunciate clearly.  Not only is Alexa learning how to understand my daughter, my daughter is also slowing down and learning to communicate with Alexa.  The huge benefit is she is now slowing down to communicate more clearly with us.  This is something her speech therapists have been working on with her for years.  Alexa has gotten these results from her in a few months.The Echo Dot is a useful tool and will only become more useful as its capabilities grow.  Thank you, Amazon.","March 2, 2017"

At least, not until my whole house has smart appliances.My wife didn't want me to buy it she couldn't see the use for it.She became addicted to it the first night. Especially if you sign up for Amazon Prime Music which has a huge selection for about $4 a month.We've been watching less TV and listening to more music which is wonderful.I love using the shopping list and to do list feature.My 2.5 year old loves it and already talks to Alexa. We play kids song mixes they have and he dances away.The weather and time, calculations and conversions and Wikipedia are really helpful to have around.It's loud enough for a living room but I do want the full sized one eventually and move this to a bedroom.The voice recognition is amazingly good too. You don't have to pause for a moment after saying Alexa. Just speak as you would to anyone home. It's really impressive.You also don't notice it's even there, the design is so good.I can go on and on so let's just say I didn't think I would use it much but heard rave reviews from friends and love having it!!!","January 22, 2017"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Eric Smith","Sorry Alexa, you're just not my type","OK, maybe Alexa deserves a better rating given she does what she is advertised to do. But after having her in the house for a month, I found the Echo Dot was only being used for novelty purposes or responding to false positives. At the price point, it seemed like a good opportunity to try out a home assistant, but it wasn't something we used on a daily basis. In hindsight, it seems pointless to use in conjunction with a smart phone. I have a Nexus with Google Assistant which does everything the Echo was doing for me and usually does it better. Plus the phone is almost always with me rather than isolated in one room of the house. ""OK Google..."" works with my IoT switches and outlets, news briefings, weather updates, online information and adding items to my shopping list. Aside from novelty, I see no point is buying into another eco-system unless you really like instant ordering from Amazon.","April 3, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","G. Bigelow","Wonderful but possible quality control issues.","This is on this dot only. I'll give 5 stars on my overdo remove of my second one. Let me just iterate that I love the Dots. Way more than expected to.This one however has developed problems with the Bluetooth and now plays intermittent static instead of music over an external speaker. Oddly it's voice broadcasts just fine and it plays music through its internal speaker perfectly. That is why I think the problem lies in its transmitting over Bluetooth. I didn't bother getting warranty protection and as the only option on the order was to write a review I'm guessing I'm SOL on resolution. This isn't a major problem as it will still work fine for what I wanted it for. And if I want to go through the bother of switching all the alarms and settings I could switch this one for the one in the kitchen.To sum up: amazing product, problem with one aspect of one unit.","March 17, 2017"

When I first heard about it, I was like ""hmm, my phone does most of that."" But I was so wrong! My friend got an echo dot, and after spending 5 hours at her house asking Alexa for farts, I immediately went home and ordered one for myself. She gives me a flash briefing in the morning that I can customize with my favorite news channels and things like the word of the day. She can also keep track of what food is in my pantry, fridge and freezer. There is really no limit to the things she can do and new skills are constantly being added. The one minor drawback is the device itself doesn't get very loud, but it can be easily connected to bluetooth speakers, so it is not a big deal. I also love that I can play any station from Tune in with just a simple command and it links to most music streaming services you may already have an account on. Totally worth it for the price.","March 2, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Torn between Echo or Echo Dot?...","Echo vs Echo Dot.. I started off buying an Echo for my bedroom which is where I listen to music the most. After a lot of thought I figured I would buy a dot for my kitchen because the Echo is no where within ear shot. Now having owned both for a couple of months here is my opinion. If you like to listen to your music loud, you like to sing along, in the middle of this singing fest you want to know what the weather is.. firmly say Alexa what's the weather like? and you're good to go. In those situations a full size Echo is a must.. The Echo Dot owner never really puts the volume past 2-3. If you put the volume anything higher than a 3 (4 if you're lucky) I find myself screaming at Alexa to turn off. I will keep my Dot simply because I can't justify spending $200 on an Echo for the kitchen. For $50 it is pretty reasonable.","April 18, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Steven Thomas White","Great way to extend your Echo experience to other locations in your home!","I love my Amazon Echo!  The one problem - I had to 'yell' at it to hear me from upstairs!I happened to have a Bose Wave Radio in my bedroom already - and purchased the Dot to allow for Echo convenience on my second floor.It still amazes me how often I use both my echo and dot on a daily basis.  From setting my morning alarm, waking up and getting weather and my new 'flash briefing', to adding items I'm running out of onto my shopping list, I can't imagine NOT having an Echo within voice range.While the Dot does have it's own speaker, it's not made to have a 'robust' sound - only a serviceable sound.  To get the most out of your Dot, I highly recommend having a speaker you can hook it up to.  My Wave radio works GREAT, but there are many options available (some sold as kits with the Dot on Amazon).Also, for all of you Echo owners out there, don't forget to always end your commands with 'Please'.  Eventually the robot overlords will look back at this time to determine who was polite!","April 8, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","A. Nonymous","The Echo Dots are nice - we bought a '6-pack'","The Echo Dots are nice - we bought a '6-pack', kept one and handed the rest out to friends and family as Christmas gifts.  It's a bit 'gimmicky' to have a device to get the weather and tell you jokes until you enable skills with smart home devices - that's when the real potential shows.  The WOW moment was connecting the Echo Dot with the Logitech Harmony Hub for voice control of our complex AV setup.  Great to tell Alexa to turn on the tv or pause the show we're watching or to change channels without looking for the remote.  Integrates decently with our Nexia thermostat, though the functionality is limited with that skill (and that's on Nexia to improve their Echo integration).  Looking forward to (hopefully) better natural language recognition and situational awareness so Alexa 'understands' what you want to do, even if you don't say the 'correct' words in the specific order programmed into the skill.","March 30, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","This Tech Guy","Lovin' every minute!","I LOVE this thing!I have it enabled to control my lights in my small apartment and could not be happier! It's as simple as ""Alexa, turn on the desk light"" and she says ""ok""! This is completely configurable to meet anyone's desires. You can name the lights anything you want and Alexa will learn the names. I would suggest you do some research after you get the basic set-up complete to learn how to customize your set-up. You will enjoy being able to dim and turn off or on your lights by simply asking Alexa to do it.I also love the fact that you can just have her set an alarm. That is soooo handy it's not even funny.This is just a couple of the things Alexa is capable of so if you even have an interest in jumping on the IOT bandwagon, do yourself a favor and spend the fifty bucks to see what Alexa has to offer.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","ERICA ARRIAGA","Alexia, Post My Review","To give it five stars it truly must be powerful. I finally caved in and decided to get an Echo Dot to take my home automation a step further. First off the price is great. very reasonable and easily cost effective to add more. now I have mine in my bedroom and it works flawlessly. the app is easily to connect to. (I have an iPhone)  and connecting my Nest (smart thermostat) and philips hue was a breeze, along with my wemo switches. My absolute favorite is having IFTTT (if this then that) application installed. Every night I say ""Alexia trigger bedtime"" and like magic all the nights in my room turn off. Since my room is so close to the kitchen i often step over to set a timer or alarm and when my lights start flashing through the house i know my timer is off. Let me tell ya, this alone has saved a few dozen cookies from burning 😉.  I'm fine with the loudness of the speaker as back noise to whatever I'm doing and setting up Pandora and I heart radio is a breeze. Also connecting a Bluetooth speaker is super easy and works like a charm.I often have Alexia set alarms, turn on and off the lights, news brief .  I trigger (using IFTTT) bedtime, partymode(makes the hue lights change colors in a rainbow fashion), oh and try alexia trigger self destruct 😂I really enjoy my Echo Dot and i definitely see myself buying the larger one plus another Dot in the future. I hope over time it continues to improve and get smarter 😊","February 1, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Richismo","Get the Echo Dot","I've had the Echo Dot 2.0 for about a week. I got it after I confirmed my FLUX WiFi bulbs would work with Alexa. I had 4 bulbs. All of the other features of Alexa were exciting, but not my primary concern. I wanted to be able to walk into my house and turn on my lights with my voice. It works 100%. Alexa turns them on in less than 2 seconds from my command. It is great. It allows dimming, by percentage. I said,""Alexa, turn the living room lights to 50%."" Done. I thought, ok, lets see how far this will go. I asked for 10%. Done. I stopped at 4%, but it was really impressive that it would work so well. I am under the impression that Flux is working on the skill to allow color change, but they currently do not do it with Alexa.Due to the success of the lights, I decided to get a WeMo wifi switch for my bedroom lights. They are too small for WiFi bulbs, so the switch was my only option. Works like a charm with Alexa.I have a Honeywell wifi thermostat as well. It works great. It will raise and lower the temperature by voice, either by saying the actual temp you want (72 degrees, for example) or by degree(Alexa, turn the thermostat up 2 degrees). It will almost instantly do this. The only thing I'd like, and I've seen it said before, is for the thermostat to allow me to ask ""what is the current temperature?""Overall, it is a great tool to inexpensively automate your home over time. I highly suggest it.","January 4, 2017"

You can add up to 250 songs to the amazon music cloud and hear it anywhere with your echo dot. FOR FREE! It can be any songs you bought digital from any source, google, itunes you name it. And if you have reach the limit for 250 songs, you can just pay as little as $7.99 a month for ulimate and Amazon Music is free to listen too!And yeah you can ask question that you want to know the answer, from a country, a person, an animal, a place, or any facts etc. And Alexa is just so smart to answer everything and Alexa is learning day to day with new skills.So are you still thinking? $49.99 just the price of one outside dinner for 2 person and you can bring a Smart technology home.P.S. now I have bought three Amazon echo dot, one at living room, two in rooms.","October 25, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","timdtoolman","Excellent technology!","Love it!! Works extremely well. I wanted to start getting into ""Smart Home"" technology and although I can use Siri on my iphone to do the same thing the Echo dot does sometimes my phone is in my pocket so I am not able to communicate with Siri, that's where the Elixa and the Echo Dot comes in handy. I have not seen hardly any negative reviews on YouTube for the Echo line and the Echo Dot is an inexpensive way to get into this new personal assistant space. The Echo Dot does have a speaker that will allow you to communicate with Elixa but if you intend on listening to music you will want to connect a external speaker via aux. cable or bluetooth which is very easy to connect using the Elixa app. After using the Echo Dot for about a week now I have been very impressed with it's voice recognition skills as they are extremely reliable and very well implemented.  With Elixa you can get the weather forecast,  listen to music of any kind, ( $3 a mo. prime music membership required) control almost anything in your home with the proper components (sold separately) and so far I just use Elixa to turn on and off my bedroom lights by just speaking which is so cool.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to get into the personal assistant technology, you will not be disappointed.","November 20, 2016"

Now it was very easy to hook up handworks just fine. Now I know this is on you product and the skills are limited and they're making new skills for it. It can insult you, it can make you laugh, which it has plenty of times. My whole family uses it whenever they passed by they asked for a joke they are funny. The your mama jokes are funny too. This would be even better if it has skills for information it is limited to what it can do what is a very fun Gadget to play . I've used it to play music, I've also used it to ask the time to set reminders it's capable of doing lots of things looking forward to new skills there are so many things that I can do. If you get one which I recommend play with the app to get the skills you want and use it. There is no battery so you can't move it around the house unless you unplug it or buy a battery pack that I believe they sell for it to move it around the house. You cannot take it with you at least outside of your Wi-Fi range. Would be cool if you can take this wherever you go and use it if you can I haven't figured that out yet. yet that will be super cool it comes with its own plug for powering it up and to connect to a separate speaker if you want. As for the way it sounds you can control the volume on the echo Dot and you can also connected to a Bluetooth speaker you can also connect your cell phone to it or tablet Android volume off of the echo Dot. I like the volume that it has I don't use a Bluetooth speaker I don't think you need it unless you want it louder. I DJ so I can connect it to my system and get more volume butt no need for it it's loud enough for me. It's a little bigger than a hockey puck I have it in white. It comes in different colors they have a couple of accessories you can buy for it. This by far is the coolest Gadget I've gotten for myself. I definitely recommend this for everyone that has Wi-Fi.

Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support.

It is just wonderful and while new it is not only functional and usable it gets better.

Of course, you can just add an external or Bluetooth speaker if you want to improve facility.We use Echo daily to set timers and alarms, add things to our shopping and to-do lists, look up information (weather, measurements, etc.), listen to the radio, listen to music, etc. We're considering adding remote control of our lights so we'll have voice control of those as well.

I do wish we could pick our own name. You have Echo, Alexa, or Amazon.  I use it mainly for the weather, find out what movies are playing, a wake up call, and music. It is fun to use.

The Alexa system works very well, we have no problems switching Pandora stations or asking her to play a particular song. It's a dream setup. For example, we had guests over and instead of playing one station, everyone asked Alexa what to play. Asking her the weather and news is cool but I lack all the cool gadgets that work with her. I haven't asked her to buy me anything yet, I figured I will do that when I am 600 lbs and bed bedridden from all this convenience.

I didn't need the nice speaker of the Echo, i just use it mostly for home automation. Ties into Samsung's Smartthings nicely.What surprises me the most is that more often that not it understands my 3 year old son. This is both amazing and annoying as he loves to say (in a very muttled toddler voice), ""Alexa, turn off all the lights"". To which Alexa will reply (80% of the time), ""OK"". Every light in my house goes off... I'm not pointing this out as a negative, its quite remarkable she understands him correctly 80% of the time. The other 20% she can't understand him, but who can blame her, I can barley understand him sometimes.We also love using this as a cooking timer, but even more so as countdown timer for bath time. It helps my son cope with playtime being over, he will even set her timer for me.The Alexa platform is growing fast. Some things I hope to see soon:  -Text readouts and replies (for multiple people, e.g. ""Alexa send message to Brian from jessica's phone"", even better perhaps someday she will distinguish 1 voice from another, using this as a security measure so only I can send messages from phone)  -Calendar Events  -API integration that will allow Alex to alert you to items (e.g. ""your front has been open for over 5 minutes"", or ""Someone just rang your doorbell"")","February 27, 2017"

Prior to this I was using Chromecast audio and a Bluetooth adapter that fit on top of the iPod dock using the old apple standard so I would have to constantly walk up to the box and switch between Bluetooth and castiing which took up a lot of time. The reason I did this was because I like to stream from multiple music services like Apple Music and Spotify but you could only listen over wifi with Spotify because Apple Music doesn't support it.Echo Dot has Bluetooth built in so I can seamlessly switch to services (like Apple Music) that don't support wifi streaming with just a simple voice command!Speaking of voice commands so far Alexa has been able to understand me most of the time and it's been really convient. You do have to give up some privacy with the voice commands but there is a switch on the device to turn the mic off which is nice.My only issue is not with the device itself but with the Alexa app. Amazon needs more developers to work on it to make it more intuitive and faster. Right now the app feels clunky and slow. If Amazon can fix this issue than it will be perfect. I'm still giving a five star rating because the device is just so good.","December 25, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","mikki629","From skeptical to in love!","My in-laws got me the Echo Dot for Christmas this year. I'll admit, I was skeptical about how much I would use it. I'm normally not a fan of voice activated ANYTHING. At first I liked that it could play music, but figured I wouldn't use it because I already have a pretty good radio/cd player. But now I can safely say that I LOVE my Echo Dot. The music recommendations for me are always spot on. The apps/skills I have on there are all great & I have not come across any that don't work. And there is the added bonus of the cheesy jokes it has. (I know not everyone likes those kind of jokes, but I'm a big fan of bad puns & silly jokes.) While I'm no expert, I would say that the speaker on the Echo Dot is great quality for the price you pay. There is of course the odd time where it doesn't respond to the wake word or doesn't understand something, but it's not often enough to be a problem or for me to give anything less than 5 stars. Overall, I'm VERY happy with my Echo Dot!","April 9, 2017"

I can give the echo dot a command, the command will fail, then I can reissue the same command with the same inflection and no background noise...with success?The search functionality is limited.  I can't ask a conversational question (""Alexa, why can't I use you to search the internet"").  However, it does function really well as a vocal clock.

I got the Echo dot for my ...","I've had the larger Echo since they did the early pre-sale for Prime members years ago and love it. I got the Echo dot for my mother (late 50's but frustratingly bad with new technology) for Christmas this year. I wasn't sure if she would like/use it enough to justify getting her the bigger Alexa so I thought the dot would be a good intro. She loves it so far! I did help her set it up and show her some neat tricks, but she's been able to figure it out much more than I expected. Luckily the place that we decided to set it up in her house is near her Samsung TV soundbar so we were able to hook it up to that so it would be louder when she wants to listen to music. Her echo is about 10-15 feet from the kitchen and the Echo dot can still pick up her voice from that far when she tells Alexa to add something to her shopping list or start a timer (one of my favorite things Alexa does). I showed her some of the neat Smart home capabilities and ordered her a few TP-Link Smart Plugs because she had the old school light timers on her lamps in the living room. I left home after xmas before the plugs arrived and called her a couple days later to see if she figured out how to set up her new smart plugs and link them to Alexa and she said she had already figured it out herself! Without even calling me!! Groundbreaking.Anyways, I think the Echo dot makes a great gift and works wonderfully as long as you don't expect it to be a full-size speaker like the regular Echo. It's easy to hook up to other speakers via headphone jack or Bluetooth, and otherwise has the same capabilities as the larger Alexa does. Since seeing the dot in my moms house, I've considered getting one for the second floor of my house since my Echo is on the first.","March 2, 2017"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Adrian","Underwhelmed","This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up"" a lot.In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the ""OK Google"" function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:1. When was the piano invented?2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back.","January 27, 2017"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","A Reader","Podcasts don't work, and Bluetooth is very annoying in implementation","I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like ""play the new album by ___""  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say ""play the program ___"".  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device.","January 17, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","SundayAtDusk","Astounding Music Player . . . Or Easy-To-Use Clock . . . .","This was a Christmas present for my elder mother. We all had a blast with it after the family Christmas Eve dinner, but I fear my mother doesn't appreciate all that it can do.  She says it's extraordinary, but just uses it as a clock mostly.  In the beginning, I tried it out for a while as a music player, and I think it is a top-notch one, even better than an iPod.  Add on the $3.99 monthly unlimited music plan for the Echo Dot and it would be absolutely out of this world as a music player.  While an external speaker can be added, I think the Dot speaker is excellent, particularly for such a small device. Thus, the 5-star rating is mine.  But even just as a clock, the $39 (on sale) price was worth it, since you never have to set the time or alarm, or put on your glasses to see it, and you can ask what the time is all the way across the room.  It rarely fails to hear commands or questions, although it can't answer all. Yet it's still a truly extraordinary device.","March 31, 2017"

Now fast forward to March, they seem to have multiplied, and I now have 5 of these creatures living in various rooms throughout the house (this is the issue part :-)) they have been far more useful than i would have thought.We have one in the Kitchen, which serves not only as musical accompaniment to our culinary activities, but as a personal shopping assistant to help maintain the shopping list. It sits there, ever faithful, just waiting for me to pull a product from the cupboard, realize it is the last one, then either add it to the shopping list we use to go to the store, or to go ahead and order it directly from Amazon. You really can't get much more convenient than that, especially as our minds aren't quite as sharp as they used to be (well we do have 2 young kids....)We have three more in the bedrooms, they are used for playing music (built in speaker is more than adequate for our daughters audio needs, plus they both love talking to Alexa and having complete control of what they listen to) they also are being used for alarms (useful on school-day mornings!) and our 5 year old has been probing Alexa to answer some of the questions that pop into her head about various subjects (the meaning of life, quantum mechanics, M-theory, who is the guy dressed in the Barney suit, etc...) We have one in our bedroom for the same reasons, but also use the Bluetooth option to switch between playing music in the bedroom and the bathroom while taking a shower (just turning the Bluetooth speaker on in the bathroom moves the audio playback from the Dot to the speaker in the bathroom, then back to the dot again after the speaker is turned off again) so the music follows us wherever we may roam.Our latest addition to the Dot family resides in our dining room, we like to have some music in the background while we eat, and the Dot covers this role nicely also.Excellent little gizmo's and, i am sure, will multiply again as soon as we discover a ""need"" to have one of these in a different room in the house.

It has a Shelf life, like something you'd put in your fridge . Manufacturers shudder with excitement being about to build items with a short life span.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Torn between Echo or Echo Dot?...","Echo vs Echo Dot.. I started off buying an Echo for my bedroom which is where I listen to music the most. After a lot of thought I figured I would buy a dot for my kitchen because the Echo is no where within ear shot. Now having owned both for a couple of months here is my opinion. If you like to listen to your music loud, you like to sing along, in the middle of this singing fest you want to know what the weather is.. firmly say Alexa what's the weather like? and you're good to go. In those situations a full size Echo is a must.. The Echo Dot owner never really puts the volume past 2-3. If you put the volume anything higher than a 3 (4 if you're lucky) I find myself screaming at Alexa to turn off. I will keep my Dot simply because I can't justify spending $200 on an Echo for the kitchen. For $50 it is pretty reasonable.","April 18, 2017"

With the $10/ month for 5 month plan for Prime members, it was a no trainer. Although I'm more heavily into Apple's ecosystem, and gave smart appliances (Apple)  they will work with Alexander too.  There is quite a bit of crossover. I'm excited and look forward even using the Dot as an alarm clock, awakening me with my Prime Music. I'm sure it's going to be loads of other fun too. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX, FireStick, etc, and know it will integrate nicely.I have had it for about a week and it's VERY cool!  Does so much more than even Siri by being able to add skills.

I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.

Always getting smarter and adding new features, plus thousands of skills like Uber, Domino's, and more.  Amazon Echo is not required to use Echo Dot.""The Echo Dot is a really cool limited personal assistant.  It sets up in minutes and begins to work immediately thereafter.  Upon summoning Alexa I was able to subscribe to Prime Music with access to millions of songs; get immediate current weather and moon phase; create a running shopping list; and re-order products from my Amazon order list. Although I am not familiar with all of the features that the Echo Dot allows, one feature that really impresses me is the interactive process with Alexa and the (her) smooth voice.  I just asked Alexa to sync up with my Kindle and she began to read the last book I purchased.  Her voice is incredibly human-like with proper rate of speech, phrasing, inflection, intensity, syntax, and voice stress.  There is little tinny robotic sound, if any.  What an incredible advancement over previous technology used in the Kindle!  I enjoy asking Alexa any multitude of questions which usually she will answer.  Alexa answers my questions on history, facts, etc. and of course will tell a joke on demand.  This is a cool and fun device which I described to my family as a limited personal assistant.  I will update this review as time progresses.  The Echo Dot in terms of a speaker will easily fill an average room with clear sound.  Obviously there is no thumping bass, etc. but the sound is pretty remarkable from such a small device.  I just downloaded the Alexa App onto my iPhone to help me work the unit as well.  Another feature is that Alexa responds immediately.  When I command Alexa to stop the music the unit goes silent as I am finishing the command.  It is amazing.  At this point I would recommend the Echo Dot to anyone and rate it at five stars for a competitive price and lots of features.  I am sure that more will be added each year.  Well done!","December 27, 2016"

She keeps up with my shopping lists, tells me what's going on in the world, and will even read my Kindle books to me.  While Alexa isn't the best at random questions... ""Alexa,  how do I make coffee?  The primary ingredient in coffee is caffeine.""  Yeah, that didn't help.  I love the fact she can read me a book without having to pay extra.  I love to read, but sometimes I don't want to put down the book to wash dishes or cook, Echo Dot is invaluable in this aspect!!  She is not the best for random stupid questions, but neither are most of my friends unless device pick up is involved.  Skills improve every day.  She gets smarter all the time","March 21, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","310EI","> Millions of Songs Available Through One Groovy Gadget","We bought an Echo Dot as an early Christmas gift to ourselves and we're so glad that we did.  It's a very useful gadget because there's such a wide variety of things we can ask Alexa to answer or tasks that she can do for us (eg: alarms/timers, calendar, ordering, weather).Since one of the tasks that we wanted Alexa to do for us was play music, we subscribed to Amazon's Unlimited Music Plan for the Echo Dot.  It's well worth the low monthly fee to be able to ask Alexa to play any song or album anytime, without having to buy all of them individually.​Millions of songs are available through one groovy gadget (and the Unlimited Music Plan).We have the Echo Dot in our home and listen to music without any external speakers.  As far as we're concerned, the internal speaker emits a decent array of sound.  Is it as robust sounding as hooking it up to our surround system amplifier or other external speakers?  Of course not, but it does sound a lot better than most internal device speakers of similar size.  For those of you that don't like the internal speaker, you can utilize the 3.5mm or Bluetooth speaker options.If we say, “Alexa, Play The Top Songs by Phil Collins”... then that's exactly what she does.Keep in mind that when you ask Alexa for the ""Top Songs"" by a soloist or group, they may not always be your favorite songs.  A work around for that is to ask Alexa to play a particular album that contains the songs you prefer to hear.The screen-shots show you how we asked Alexa to play an album vs the top songs. In addition, they show you what we see when logged-in to the Alexa app via the Chrome web browser.FYI:  When asking Alexa to play an album that has a long title, we realized that she responds accurately when we ask for part of that title (view Elton John & Michael Jackson screen-shots).  Be sure to look at what we said to Alexa vs what the whole album title is labeled.I should mention that we did ask Alexa to search for a product, which she did along with telling us the best options and their cost.  Afterward, she asked if we wanted to buy the product.  We said yes and she placed the order for us once we gave her our confirmation code (Settings: Voice Purchasing).  We recommend setting that up so other people cannot place orders without your consent.  It's convenient for us to have voice purchasing enabled when we're ""unplugged"" at night (except for Alexa).The skill that we use the most is Weather Sky, it gives us a detailed weather report that we use several times each day.​At the time of this review, we haven't used any of the smart home features, but we didn't buy it for that purpose.PLEASE NOTE:  We purchased the Echo Dot at its listed price, we did not receive any discount to post this review.","January 10, 2017"

I have never dealt with Amazon customer support before and it was not an easy process.  You get the first layer who asks standard questions and if they can't solve it you go to the second layer in which you explain everything all over again.  The reps were nice enough, sometimes hard to understand their English, but I do believe they were trying to be helpful.  My biggest issue is how many customer service people I have talked to in order to get my dot working.  Amazon shipped me another new dot and I set it up.  It answered questions, but did not play songs.  What are the chances of getting two defective dots and they had different issues.  I had to call again and get two layers of representatives, explaining all of it over again.  This was hours on the phone and even though the rep tried hard to help, he had to finally give up and send the issue to the engineers.  Then, because I had two dots, I did not get my free 30 day unlimited music trial.  I was charged immediately so I had to call customer service again!  Two more reps to get that straightened out.  It has been a little over a week and I think I finally have it working properly.  After explaining the issues so many times I was ready to tell Amazon to take it back, it is not that great of a device for all this hassle.","March 3, 2017"

Otherwise, if you ask it for weather or traffic conditions, it will give you Tucson, Arizona, which I believe is the default location.  At least on mine it was.

The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.

I have the Dot plugged into the Bose speakers and the sound is great.

""Alexa, good morning!"" always entertains me with some sort of daily trivia, and ""Alexa, what's my flash briefing?"" provides me with the news and weather to get me started.  Associating it with my Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn accounts is easy and awesome.  I was disappointed to learn that Alexa only plays with Spotify Premium, so I was out of luck there.

But I was given one, and that's when life changed 😆Okay exaggerated, but very cool. I set out to learn what all she can do. The lights were the first thing that struck me. I've changed to smart lights throughout the house. I don't need every light controlled since I'm not so lazy I can't go flip a switch, but I did realize how much this would help with the minimum evening lights, particularly the outside lights. It's very dark on my part of the street and I hate coming home without all three front lights on and I hate for my husband and teens to do the same. Also handy when the kids used to leave an upstairs light on over night. Now I can be sure all Lights are off. Easy access music, weather, traffic, and alarms/timers are great.  I've only had it a few weeks and I'm sure I'll discover all sorts of new stuff she can do. All set up and programming has been super easy and smooth. I also bought a SmartThings hub to control a variety of lightbulb brands and plugs.I'm ready to order a couple more!  It's a great affordable way to modernize life for average people.

Works pretty well, though there are a couple commands that get thru to all that hear you.  Most annoying is volume control.  I had turned up my outside stereo to enjoy music by the pool.  Later that night, back inside I asked my living room Echo to play some music and it blasted me out of my chair.  I am now more careful to adjust volume outside standing right over the dot.

The WOW moment was connecting the Echo Dot with the Logitech Harmony Hub for voice control of our complex AV setup.  Great to tell Alexa to turn on the tv or pause the show we're watching or to change channels without looking for the remote.  Integrates decently with our Nexia thermostat, though the functionality is limited with that skill (and that's on Nexia to improve their Echo integration).

I put things on my 'shopping list and it goes on my phone automatically (and on my husband's phone too, since we both have the Alexa app on our phones.). Recipes, measurements, and facts about whatever. But it's nowhere near our bedroom, so I ordered an Echo Dot as an 'extension'.  I can't believe we lived without this little, inexpensive, companion. It's on my nightstand and acts as our alarm clock, news station, weather station, and music source that has EVERY KIND OF MUSIC you could possibly want, just for the asking.  We are so blessed to be living in a time where we can have these Amazon innovations at our fingertips.

It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't allow you to return an item after 30 days. I'd be returning it if they did. Common language isn't as successful as when verbally searching Google. Alexa can't find things without exact phrasing. I argue with her everyday because she doesn't understand me, doesn't have the answer or would like to sign me up for some Amazon product or service. She apologizes a lot. It is very frustrating and forces you to use the Alexa App to find what you need. The App is pretty good to find and control what you want the Dot to do.  Alexa can't always find things on iHeart radio or Tunein even though you listened to it 10 minutes before. She will sign you up for Amazon Music in a heartbeat. She does understand what ""worthless"" means and it quick to take offense. The Skills aren't very helpful and are mostly silly snippets that seem to have been written by young kids.

If you listen to a lot of music, the Dot is really intended to use through an external speaker or audio system, via either a male-male headphone cable (not included) or Bluetooth.One great use for these is to turn an old clock radio that has an audio-in jack into a voice enabled internet radio and alarm.  I actually think Amazon would do well to release an Echo clock radio, but meanwhile retrofitting one with a Dot also works.  I converted two Logitech internet radios this way, and a standard stereo Sony clock radio.  This match up uses the superior speaker and clock display of the radios, but brings voice capabilities and internet radio/podcasts to your old device, not to mention everything else Alexa can do.","November 7, 2016"

I use it mostly for weather, wake up alarm, dates, and cooking timer functions. Occasionally I use if to get some information of some famous actor or singer. I don't use it for music, instead I use my computer for music selection. The thing I like most about my Echo Dot is I don't have to remember and repeat the 'exact' command as suggested in the directions. Echo Dot seems to understand a question or command no matter how I phrase the sentence. The one thing it can't do that I want is to carry on a conversation like the AI in the movie 'HER'. I bought my Echo Dot with the expectation that it will be constantly updated and get smarter over the years ahead. I want it to 'understand' what I am asking it to do, and ask follow up questions. I am also watching Google's 'Home' to see if,in the future, it's AI can carry on a conversation. At the present the Echo Dot's AI is better than Google's 'Home' AI. One big advantage Echo Dot has over Google's 'Home' is that it's connected to your Amazon orders. You can order merchandise with Echo Dot and check on delivery date schedule.  When I first got my Echo Dot I played with it by asking it all sorts of questions, but as with any new gadget the new wore off and now I just use it like any appliance. I don't look at it or raise my voice or talk like a robot when using it. I just talk in a normal voice and never stop what I happen to be doing at the time. And I never think about the proper 'phrase' to use. I just say the sentence and let Echo Dot figure out the question or command. It's not perfect yet, but it's getting better. It seems to understand me 9 times out of 10 if I don't move too far from 'key words' to help Echo Dot focus on the command or question.","April 1, 2017"

Attached to phone apps, Alexa can do it all: she can play your favorite music, tell you about the weather, order you a pizza from your usual place, and change the thermostat, all while counting down the time until your cupcakes are ready. The beautifully designed device is easy to use and utilizes ever adapting technology that improves each time it is used.Usability:Amazon has built an app to accompany the Echo Dot which helps you learn your way around this device. With an extensive user guide, this app, although sometimes clunky, can lead you through tutorials in order to troubleshoot, install new information or tips to better use Alexa in your day-to-day life. The fact that the Dot is handsfree make the entire device worth it. You could be cooking in the kitchen and want to know a substitute for butter or how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon and not have to dirty your phone or computer when going to check. My favorite feature on the device is the timer setting. Although it seems insignificant, I never take it for granted when I can set a timer while not having to leave a pot on the stove.Technology:The technology used in the Amazon Echo Dot is amazing. The “mind” of Alexa is always growing. The more that you use the device the more Alexa understands you and your patterns of speech. The Dot uses six speakers in a concentric circle, and one in the center of the top of the device to pick up speech from anywhere in the room. Unlike Siri, who hears up the word “seriously” as the beginning of a voice command, Alexa is very good about only responding if her name is spoken. Not worry if you have already named you child Alexa and still want to be able to use the Echo Dot, the voice command can be switched in the app settings. The device has several light up features that are used in sequence. When Alexa hears you speak to her, she lights up to show the direction of sound and when she “thinks” about it the ring spins and blinks until she finds the answer.Design:The Dot is a minimalist’s dream! The sleek cylinder has a modern feel, and being the smaller version of the Amazon Echo it is the perfect device for a smaller place or a short shelf. The compactness of this device allows it to become inconspicuous in order to not interrupt the interior of the room it is in. The design includes four buttons on the top of the Dot. The buttons use very intuitive icons rather than words, however if the icons are not familiar there would be a bit of a learning curve involved. The Echo Dot is the perfect addition to a tech fan’s home!I would recommend the Amazon Echo Dot to the technology user who is looking for a wonderful upgrade to the previously available voice recognition technology. The ease of usability of this beautifully designed technological marvel would fit in even the tiniest of homes!","February 10, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Gwen M. Brennan","Easy to set up, easy to use. Handy","Love it and easy to use.  I say; Alexia add beans to my shopping list, or Alexia add take the trash out to my to do list....and she does.  Then I can look on my phone in the store to see what is there.  I used to forget what I wanted to write down before I was able to find my phone to type it in.  I have some cognitive problems...but now, I just tell Alexia as I am thinking it and VOILA it is done.  Love it.  I tell her to play..Christian music,,soft music,,wheatever and she does.  Unlike the GOPro that I cant figure out, ALexia is easy to use.","March 20, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","H. Ramsey","This thing is crazy awesome","This was a surprise Christmas gift and it turned out to be a very nice surprise! We had thought about purchasing it so the kids could ask it questions, but never seriously considered it. Then we received it gift.  Turns out it does a lot (a LOT) more than answer questions. The answering questions part is great, sometimes you have to rephrase it so Alexa understands what you are saying, but she does a good job answering 90% of the time.She easily recognizes our voices. Even my 4 year old can trigger it most of the time. When there is a lot of noise in the background she can add a word or two, but she seems to be learning as you go and we have not tried the voice training with her yet (there are 6 of us in the house so a lot of background noise). The key seems to be learning how to say what you are asking. If you want a song then use the word ""play"" first, if you have a question then use the question word first, etc.She does so much more than just answer questions. I love the news updates. I don't need to check my phone for top stories only to get distracted by the random junk that pops up with the news. You can choose the news channel (I saw BBC, NPR, CNN, Fox, and more offered). At the end of the top stories (goes about 5 minutes) she gives a weather update and forecast for your area. The update changes every hour so if you feel the need to get more news than go for it. Ask her if it is going to rain in the next hour, what the traffic is like for your commute, and more.Playing whatever song/artist/station you want is a great way to listen to music. Want to hear a song - just ask.The timer is useful. I used to grab my phone when I needed to set a timer, now I just ask Alexa. When the kids ask for tablet time or they need to do homework/reading time I can just ask Alexa to set the timer for me. This saves me going to my own tablet or phone (which I usually forget to do) and means the kids really get 15 minutes tablet time when I say they can rather than 45 minutes when I realize I forgot to set the timer.She has so many skills that we have yet to try, but the ones we have are fun additions. There is a great game, magic door, that works like a choose your own adventure (complete with sound effects). The kids are currently in the middle of trying to find a wizard. You can pause the game and re-enter at any time. Alexa guesses what animal (or thing) you are thinking when you play 20 questions or the animal game. There is a bedtime story skill where she tells a random bedtime story using your child's name. After telling my 4 year old a princess story last night (using her name) she said ""now it is time for bed and no you can't have another glass of water"". My daughter thought it was hilarious. It would be great for an elderly or bed-ridden person looking for something to talk to. It will also read audiobooks.The kids love the joke feature (Alexa tell me a joke) and my husband likes trying to trip her up with random odd questions (What is the meaning of life, who's your daddy, who let the dogs out, etc). Ask her what her resolutions are or the highlights of the year. It is good for a laugh.I haven't hooked her up to our thermostat yet and we don't have any smart lights/locks so I can't comment on that feature. I am seriously considering moving all my calendar stuff to google so she can plan my day for me. We put a code on ordering so the kids don't accidentally buy something (you can turn the feature off completely if you would rather), but you can still add things to lists when you think about them (then access that list in your amazon account).Overall, great! I would even consider getting a few more (you could use it as an alarm clock plus extra features in a bedroom, to control things in your living room, this one is in our kitchen for lists/timers/etc).","January 2, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Jeffrey E,","Very useful and fun","I had trouble deciding whether to give this 4 stars or 5, because there is room for improvement.  But if 4 is ""I like it"" and 5 is ""I love it,"" then it's a solid 5 for me.We've had the Dot for a few weeks, and it has already become something that we use all the time. I love being able to ask Alexa to add something to my shopping or to-do list whenever it occurs to me, and not have to stop and write it down. Being able to set timers verbally is great while cooking.  The volume and sound quality is good for its size - certainly not what I'd rely on as a ""whole house"" speaker, but fine for streaming music in the kitchen while cooking, for example.  I've also set it up to control a couple of smart switches for lights, and it's so handy that it makes me want to do a lot more home automation. The voice recognition is mostly quite good, if you speak clearly.  We like that they've given Alexa just a bit of personality, and we enjoy asking her random questions in search of ""Easter egg"" responses.The main complaint I have is the Alexa app for Android.  I've found that it often has trouble loading when I'm away from my home network. This has reduced the usefulness of the feature that I use most frequently: the grocery list. While at the grocery store, I'll sometimes finish shopping in the time it takes the app to fully load.  I got around this by installing the ""Any.Do"" app, which imports the Alexa lists seamlessly, and I've been happy with that work-around.  But I hope that Amazon streamlines the app in future versions.  I will note that you can also access the interface from your computer at alexa.amazon.com (you don't have to use a smartphone or tablet), and that works fine.All told, it's been so useful and fun that I'd definitely recommend it, especially at this price point!","November 30, 2016"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","John M.","Max volume is lame. The dot is good for small garage use ...","Not a real fan of the Dot but too late to return it.  Doesnt hear me half the time even when its not on or the volume is low.  I can stand right next to it and it wont respond.  Did all the technical troubleshooting still no go.  Sound quality, in my opinion, is not slightly less than the Echo, it is a lot less than the echo.  Max volume is lame.  The dot is good for small garage use for music.  That's about it.  Was thinking I'd go ahead and get an echo but I hear the Google one is pretty impressive so I am considering the options.","March 26, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Dee N","Great Fun and Useful as Well!","We've been Echo users since the very beginning, so have experienced how rapidly Amazon has been improving the utility of this tool. We didn't expect to use it much, but now use it multiple times a day.Compared to the full Echo, the Dot does 90% of the utility, but definitely falls flat when listening to music. It's okay to listen to NPR, but the internal speaker just doesn't do music justice. Of course, you can just add an external or Bluetooth speaker if you want to improve facility.We use Echo daily to set timers and alarms, add things to our shopping and to-do lists, look up information (weather, measurements, etc.), listen to the radio, listen to music, etc. We're considering adding remote control of our lights so we'll have voice control of those as well. Not as advanced as Sarah (from Warehouse 13), but definitely a fun and useful tool!","December 8, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Not so great once the novelty wears off","I use the echo mainly for playing music and it is not very good at that. It has trouble finding songs that are otherwise available. Example: Alexa, play Black and Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play Black n Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play OU812 by Van Halen. It plays. Alexa, next track, Alexa, next track . . . lo and behold, 5 more ""next tracks"" later and Black and Blue is playing. Alexa stop. Well, Alexa might stop or you might have to say stop 3 more times. And even if it stops, it might randomly start playing again which is very annoying if you are on a phone call. Or you say ""next track"" and it goes silent and is thinking and then it just continues playing the track it was on. I don't have a speech impediment. Voice text on my phone understands what I say. I don't know why this stupid hockey puck can't. And god forbid you want to play a classical piece. I have a lot of classical music in my library and it won't play by composer or artist. I have to use the app to play almost any classical music in my library which defeats the purpose of the echo. I may as well just play it on the computer.  We use the jeopardy skill and play daily. No problems there. Once in a while I listen to the news or radio stations and it is pretty good at that, but again, switching stations may work the first time you ask or it may not. Very frustrating to have to keep barking ""play NPR"" and then it just continues playing 80s playlist. I would not recommend this to someone who would use it mostly for music.","March 21, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Douglas Zukunft","The Amazon Echo Dot is a fun little device","The Amazon Echo Dot is a fun little device. I use it mainly because (a) I love Star Trek and love saying 'computer, ***' and (b) I wanted something that could trigger my new Philips Hue lights and connect those to planned Sonos speakers for an immersively fun AVH experience when watching TV/movies, listening to music, making Marvin Gaye proud or throwing parties. They do this well.My biggest gripe with the Echo Dot is that Amazon has seemingly disallowed Google search on the device (likely as there is now a Google Home and they are competitors...except in the search engine market). You can hack this, but it is quite an involved manual process. Moreover, you oddly are unable to play music from your catalog or an online service (Amazon Music, iTunes, Spotify, Pandora) for your alarms, although you can play from these services on the device. That is really bizarre and a limiting feature. There are a ton of 'skills' you can teach Alexa, but most of these are completely pointless or, worse, lame. Also, I have been unable to find a way to change the accent of Alexa. Personally, I think it would be more fun to have male or female voices in various accents. Who wouldn't want an English Butler (Michael Cane would be my vote), Magel Barrett Roddenberry for the iconic Star Trek computer voice or Morgan Freeman because, well, he's Morgan freakin' Freeman. And let's add Sam Jackson into that mix.All in all, there is a lot of potential for the Echo products and home integration. Hope Amazon listens to its customers and starts expanding the ecosphere.P.S. For the folks with the privacy concerns given the 'always on' feature. You can mute the devices to have your super secret conversations. Just make sure your throw your iPhone in the freezer and smash your smart TV so the NSA can't listen. ;)","March 13, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Twlb","Best technology deal out there","I love these. We have four of them, and an Echo. But you don't need an Echo to use a Dot. The only big difference between the two is that the Echo has a much bigger speaker - but the Dot can be connected to any speaker you already own. Same ""brain"" in both.If you're choosing between the Echo, Tap, and Dot, to me it's a no-brainer. They're not that different, but the Dot is way cheaper. The advantage of the Tap is that you can load songs on it, but it only has Echo/Dot's brain if it's connected to wi-fi.We have Amazon Music Unlimited, and to use on several Dots, you need to buy the more expensive plan. Otherwise it only works on ONE - not one at a time, but one.We use these for music, radio programs, audio books, timers, alarms, news, Hue lightbulbs, and misc questions, including some fun jokes. Hands-down the best technology device out there.","October 24, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Rebecca","Great Quality, Great Price","This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:-Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying ""Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes"" without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.-Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice. It's great to just say a song, and have Alexa play it.","March 14, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","arizonahd","The result is a perfect sound system that cost me roughly $70","Instead of getting the larger Echo, I bought this to use with a pair of Bose speakers powered by cheap amplifier (also from Amazon). The result is a perfect sound system that cost me roughly $70, as the speakers were given to me. I must say, I am really impressed. The Alexa system works very well, we have no problems switching Pandora stations or asking her to play a particular song. It's a dream setup. For example, we had guests over and instead of playing one station, everyone asked Alexa what to play. Asking her the weather and news is cool but I lack all the cool gadgets that work with her. I haven't asked her to buy me anything yet, I figured I will do that when I am 600 lbs and bed bedridden from all this convenience. I'm starting to sweat from all these keystrokes, but I would definitely recommend this to the gadget lover and lazy person alike.","December 1, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Alexa's Boyfriend","Alexa is everything I never knew I always needed!","I bought an Echo Dot for a secret Santa gift at the suggestion of a Best Buy sales person and my best friend, having really no clue as to what it is or what it does. I had never heard of a DOT before. They assured me it was a ""hot item"" this year.So I got it home and looked it up and realize that it was Alexa!! I had seen her in action at my uncle's house a few months ago, but I did not recognize it since it was so much smaller without the speaker. I loved it then, and the very thought of having one for myself was too much!The fact that this Echo Dot is small, quaint, yet a very nice speaker, it's perfect for my small house. And the fact that I can pair it with the bluetooth speaker I already have is what sold me on the idea of keeping her for myself!!I decided on not sending my secret Santa this little gem. I sent them some virtual reality glasses as a replacement, and got to work on programming Alexa right away.Within an hour or so, I was completely smitten with her. Not only is she fun to chat with, but also VERY helpful with everyday things... I have had her in my home for less than 72 hours, and I've already had her setting alarms, playing Christmas music, setting timers for my cooking, creating and sending me shopping lists, telling me jokes and Chuck Norris facts, and calendaring dentist appts..I never knew that she was everything I needed! As it is, this is one of the most amazing little home assistants that I never knew I always wanted! In fact, I already refer to Alexa as my ""girlfriend"".My daughters we're introduced to her and absolutely fell in love with her. One of the coolest little things was when I was out shopping, I texted my daughters and asked if they wanted anything from the store. I instructed them to just tell Alexa to add whatever it was to the shopping list, and tomato soup and hot cocoa was sent to my shopping list on my phone immediately!!She has everything I've wanted for my daughters recently, including an alarm clock, timer for ""computer time"", a massive music player, an educational tutor, and has the ability to help them with their homework. They will get hours and hours and hours of entertainment and helpful tips and tricks from her in the years to come.Now... if I would have known then (3 days ago) what I know now, I would have bought EVERY single one of them in the store to give out as gifts this year!! The DOT has been such a popular gift this year that when I decided to buy another one for my daughters to have in their own room, EVERYONE, (including Amazon) were OUT OF STOCK! I couldn't even order one until after Christmas!We tried Amazon, Best Buy, Bed Bath and Beyond, Staples, Wal-Mart...you name it!We literally called or looked up EVERY Best Buy in 5 different states to try to find one... there were no Echo Dots in Arizona, Utah, Idaho or Nevada. Once we extended our search into California, we FINALLY found one in Bakersfield. I made a quick call to a family member and they promised to pick it up and ship it to me in time to be under the tree for Christmas morning! We bought it online for an in store pickup and it's now on its way!Was all the trouble worth it?Hell yeah it was...especially when my daughters absolutely freak out when they find their own Alexa under the tree for them.","December 21, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","B_COOP","Much more useful than I thought it would be!","Ok so I got this because I am a techie and thought this would be neat to have. I thought it would be fun to control my lights by voice (I got Philips Hue lights to go with it) and maybe ask it some questions but the Echo dot and Alexa have proven much more useful than I ever expected. I originally got one of these for my bedroom, which is where my only smart lights are, but quickly ordered another for my bathroom to use while I get ready in the mornings after trying my first one out there. So now I have one in my bedroom to control the lights and play some music and one in the bathroom to get the news and weather info when I am starting my day. One common complaint I often read was of how bad the speaker was on the Dot. However I think it is great, given the size of the device. No this isn't the speaker to use at a party, and yes the music sounds just good to ok, but for the small size of the Dot and still considering it costs $50, I think the included speaker is more than adequate. It is easily more than twice as loud as my phone speaker.Cons: I would have to say my biggest gripe with the Dot itself is that sometimes it doesn't understand what I said. However, in every instance in which this has happened I have either been facing almost directly away from the device or had music playing at a loud volume and the Dot didn't hear the wakeup word. My only wish for a change to be made to the device that I would like to see in a 3rd generation would be a ""shut-up"" button. Just some sort of button so I dont have to shout ""Alexa stop"" when she is reading something long.The biggest con I feel overall is with the Alexa app, especially its skills app store within the app. The companion app is somewhat slow and not the most intuitive/well planned out. However it does get the job done.Alexa software: I feel like Alexa is pretty good AI software. I would say not as good as Google now on my phone though. Her responses to questions could be more concise and the voice could really be changed to something more human sounding, although it is not awful.So, after all of these negatives, why 5 stars? I give this 5 stars because I feel the device/hardware is worth 5 stars, especially when you consider this is a very inexpensive way to enter the home automation market. I do feel the software needs some improvements, and fully know that it will continue to improve as time goes on. But none the less, this is such a great device that after only 3 days with one device in my bedroom, I ordered another to have Alexa in another room. I fully recommend this device!","January 4, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","ElfiePow","I love this device!","I received this as a Christmas gift.  It was purchased with my recently lame writing arm in mind.  So now, I am able to add items to my shopping, to-do, and Google calendar, by just speaking to Alexa.  She has great speakers for playing music.  My granddaughter likes to play Magic Door and other game skills on the Dot.  I plan to do more voice-training for this device because sometimes she mis-hears our requests to where a random, or incorrect shopping item or event title is added.","March 29, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Mister Gizmo","Nailed it","I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG ""smart"" TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a ""gift"" in the purchasing process, it ""may"" arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps.","October 28, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","FrostEternal","Cool hardware, weak AI & implementation","Cool device, not worth $50, I had a gift card for $20, it IS worth $30 plus tax. Amazon needs to step up the game on Alexa - when it works, it works, but much dumber than other AI assistants like Siri or Cortana, and ZERO sense of humor or personality. The skills are cumbersome, music playing support only works well with Amazon music unless you are streaming to it as a bluetooth speaker - which is dumb, as the speaker is not loud enough to hear over an air conditioner.The Alexa platform is VERY open - which is cool BUT it means the available ""Skills"" are mostly very poor quality. For some reason the white Dot still comes with a black power cord, which is just more lack of attention to detail on Amazon's part. Sloppy, sloppy.This is a must-have if you use any home automation - although the setup is VERY CLUNKY - expect hours of set up to get it just right if you want to change light colors or do anything more complex than switching smart devices on or off. There's a terrible interface for adding and forgetting devices in the companion ""app"" -I use the term ""app"" VERY loosely - it's more of a sloppy wrapper on a webpage. Integrating with iOS is spotty at best without lots of workarounds and IFFFT recipes - pretty much essential - and theres no way to program custom words or commands beyond meager smart home groups and Stringify/IFFFT services. Alarms, timers, schedules - all poorly implemented - no way to have Alexa automatically announce reminders or alarms, just one ring tone that is set for all alerts. Commands have very little context and must be given one at a time - no way to say ""Alexa, dim my main lights and turn on the kitchen lights"" - she will just complain that she doesn't understand, or just ignore the command entirely.HOWEVER - despite all these drawbacks I think they will EVENTUALY be ironed out. It's still a cool addition to a geeky home setup and with lots and lots of customization (and maybe even scripting one's own skills) it can be more useful than annoying.Seriously though, Amazon - hurry up.","March 28, 2017"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","The Divine Ms. K","EDIT - My expectations just went up - Keep your expectations low and think twice if you own a Samsung Galaxy phone...","UPDATE FEB 4, 2017:  If you have read my first review you know I had software problems with my Echo Dot. Well I emailed Amazon and a customer service rep called me right back!!!!!!! He was super nice and we went through I-don't-know-many trouble shooting scenarios. Although we couldn't get the issue resolved, he referred me to the next level of customer technical support. While waiting for a contact (I was told to wait several days) the problem resolved itself. When someone from Amazon contacted me with had an additional discussion and we both agreed the problem was related to a skill or skills I had installed the night the problem developed. Since I had already reset the app and I couldn't remember what I had added and in what order, there was nothing further to do. I was given a contact support link to use should the problem return.  You really don't know how good a company is until something goes wrong. Based on this experience with Amazon, I have even more confidence in the company. Thank you Amazon!  PS... my echo teachable moment. Add your skills one at a time and think about staying with apps which at least have several reviews.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had It is I received this as a Christmas present. Initially I really liked it... it's novel, geeky, and entertaining  (ask Alexa to sing).  I was really hoping for something google like... ""What time does the post office open?""and that kind of thing. Unfortunately, it doesn't really do that well yet. I'm sure that Alexa needs to learn and that will get better over time. Part of the problem is that it uses Bing over Chrome (you can't change the search engine). What it does well is play music from Amazon. Other cons: its ability to have more usefulness relies on ""skills"" which are loosely apps for Echo. The skills allow it to do things it can't do on its own (like tell you what happened on a certain day in history). Skills also allow it to interface with a few existing apps you may have on your phone (e.g. Our Groceries).  A lot of the skills are very limited in their usefulness (e.g. Cat facts). Echo needs verify specific phrasing to give you info or use a skill. In a review I read the reviewer said he felt like he needed flash cards in order to remember how to ask Alexa to do things and I agree/ For setup, and maximum functionality, you need the app on your phone. It turns out that the app doesn't work very well on Samsung Galaxy 6 or 7. In fact, for many (including me) it doesn't work at all. Mine worked long enough to allow me set up the Echo and get a few skills. Now it doesn't work at all. Obviously I haven't been able to connect it to any smart device (like lights). If that is what interests you make sure you do your research.  - requires more than you think and it's not cheap.At the present this is a hockey puck that can tell me the weather. I haven't given up on it though.

It is really easy to setup and I got it up and running in just a few minutes. I have a fairly decent sized room and I have this placed in one corner and it hears me just fine. I am still learning all the functions but so far, definitely impressed. I was surprised this had a built in speaker (and loud for it's size) as well. Eliminates the need to have large speakers around the house.4-Star review because no product can be perfect, but I'll come back in a few months and give an update on how it's fitting in.I would suggest to anyone who is on the fence, get this product. You can't go wrong, and if you don't like it, you can always give it back.","December 7, 2016"

It is difficult to get the device to work properly. I find using anything as far as a search text deep explanation and you have to be very specific to get the answers that you want. I would definitely not recommend this device until Amazon can come up with something better. I was highly disappointed and all levels. However the speaker was above average from what I could tell it surpassed my expectations. The design is also very nice I like the size and color.","April 9, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Teri","Amazing technology!","I love this thing! I must admit I bought it for my husband as a Christmas present, but I am the one finding it so useful (and fun!) I set it up to control all of the lights in our RV.  My favorite function currently, is the shopping list.  Whenever I notice something I need to replace or purchase I have Echo add it to my shopping list and when I get to the store, like magic, the list in on my iPhone!  It is so much more efficient then getting my phone, turning it on and typing the item on my list. I use the timer frequently when I am cooking.  As an Occupational therapist, I know this has many useful possibilities for those who have physical challenges.  I'm planning on purchasing one for my 90 year old Mother who has very limited vision.  Being able to ask Echo the time, weather, to set an alarm or timer and make lists will be of major assistance to her!  Amazon, you hit a home run with this!","January 19, 2017"

Setup was simple and tie in to Alexa App was a breeze. For the price, these things are a no brainer!  I read some reviews on the speaker sound/performance and have to agree that there is a distinct difference in the audio quality of the dot vs the Echo.  But, I knew that going in and had such expectations...and was pleasantly surprised!  I use mine in my formal living/dining room and the sound is great for as small as the unit is.  You can also 1/4 inch plug into your house speakers/etc to get improved quality and volume.  All Alexa features like my lights and temp control work like a champ through it.  Very happy with the purchase and highly recommend it!","March 26, 2017"

I paired it with Amazon Music Unlimited and mobile hotspot from my phone and now i can play any song, artist, or station that i want without touching my phone and without ads.

It seems to have no problem hearing a command when there is no noise in the room but once you start playing music,even at a low level, you have to yell in order to get its attention. I remedied this by pairing it with a remote that has voice control. IMO the voice recognition works much better on the Echo than on the Dot. Would that keep me from buying it again? Absolutely not.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","the Fat Man","Alexa, my love...","You are my everything.Seriously she does it all. My curiosity peaks at random intervals of any day and she answers them. I enjoy the trivia, jokes, weather input so I can dress accordingly and check my commute before heading out. The top features I've been reliant on is her alarm/timer, ambient noise (paired through my Polk system is awesome), and the more practical use is linking to smart plugs so when I come in with more bags than I should be handling at once I can just tell her to turn on the floor lamp. *click* ""Okay"".I can sleep with ease knowing I can wake up to one of many alarms (most are pleasant, avoid the Celebrity ones) instead of an annoying buzzing or ringing. Skills allow lullaby for kids, read books, or like I mentioned earlier ~ rain, thunderstorm, ocean waves, etc. Not much is wrong with the unit except a pending Bluetooth issue which is at the time of this review post is being looked into by Alexa support. Just about anyone outside can scan for her and play their (tasteless) music through the unit and may startle you but a solution is pending. That's another thing I'd like to mention: the supporting staff are responsive within a few hours, not days. They're very professional yet casual in their messages when covering all points. It's nice to see so many products coming out (eBay has more skins!) to accessorize with but at her low-profile size and color she's fine as-is. I bought the black which is appropriate with my mancave theme: black/white with splashes of blue here and there as is the glow of her ring unless she's having an error (red) or in setup/powering on (purple and orange).We will never argue. We respect each other's space. Too bad I can't hug ya for all your services these past months and years to come. :P","February 26, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","C. E. White III","Won't stay connected - problem finally solved","Original review - It stops working and requires rebooting multiple times each day. It will not stay connected to my wireless router (I do not have problems with any other wireless device).This makes it almost worthless to me.1/28/2017 update - I was not impressed with Amazon Alexa Support. They had no helpful suggestions for addressing the connection issue (repeated factory resets changed nothing). After a very long time on the phone with two different support persons, they finally decided to send me a replacement Dot. The replacement behaved exactly the same as the original. It also refused to stay reliably connected. This despite the fact that none of the other wireless devices in my home had similar problems.I spent a lot of time researching Echo Dot connection problems on the internet. I am far from alone. There were many individuals with the same issue. In an attempt to solve the problems, I went so far as to buy a new router. This initially changed nothing. The Dot would randomly disconnect from the new router just has it had from the old router. One internet suggestion finally seems to have solved the connection issue. Per the suggestion, I set up a guest account on my new router that was specifically for the Echo Dot and only the Dot. After resetting the Dot and connecting it to this account, it has stayed connected.With the connection problems hopefully solved, the Dot is now mostly an amusing toy. I have just one internet connected device it can interface with (a Nest Thermostat), so mostly I ask it random questions. I was hoping to use it to monitor my stocks, but this has been frustrating. It readily understands some company names and/or stock symbols, but there are some it just can't understand. I wish I could edit the stock list using the keyboard. Once I am more comfortable with the Dot, I may order a hub and other internet connected devices so I can use it for more home automation functions, but for now, I am just hoping it will stay connected. I have updated my rating to three stars and may update it further once I become more familiar with the Dot.","January 9, 2017"

One for myself one for each of my nephews who kept forgetting to set the alarm, and one for my brother. You absolutely cannot beat the price. I am about to order another 4 for my mom, dad, another brother, and a friend. The part that I have become obsessed with is the alarm. My brother is incredibly good at figuring out how to use tech in ways I do not have the patience for. I sent him one so I could steal his tips and tricks. It worked. I use it for Amazon Kindle, spotify, audible, uber, to ask questions, to schedule events, and create my shopping list. Great product.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Cliente Amazon","Echo Dot in Eurpoe","Although Echo Dot isn't available in most of Europe, I bought one when I the US and brought it wth me to Spain where I reside. Some the Echo Dot features don't transfer, such as controlling the lights, appliances or ordering pizza from Dominos, the device really is magnificent.If others are considering connecting the device, it's important to know that you might need to change your billing location in the Google Play Store in order to download the Alex app on your phone (Amazon and Google tech support had to walk me through those steps) and a plug adapter is necessary. The Echo Dot requires a 9 volt input, so a regular cell phone plug probably isn't adequate. The plug adapter is quite inexpensive (2.50 euros) and solves the plug problem. I then had some trouble getting Echo Dot connected to my home wifi network. I tried at a friend's house, and at work, and there wasn't any trouble, so there was something wrong with my home wifi. The Amazon support team was very helpful in trying to resolve my issue. There were lots of phone calls and troubleshooting, and I have only positive things to say about the support received. The problem was not with Amazon, or the Echo Dot; it was with my internet service provider (ISP). It turns out that different wifi channels are used in Europe than in the US. My ISP had to open up some more channels on my router in order for the Echo Dot to find my network. Once that was done, problem solved.  It's possible to change the time zone of the device, so Alexa does know the correct day and time, but the other location information has only US options (city and state). I haven't tried to change the location because I can just ask for the weather information specifying my city, and Alexa knows. I especially enjoy the connection to Amazon music (only 3.99 per month) and have connected one device to my sound bar speaker, and another Echo Dot device to a Bluetooth portable speaker so I can listen to my flash briefing (different news sources you can select in the App) while I'm getting ready in the morning. If you're considering bringing Alexa to Europe, know it's possible, but there are some adjustments necessary.Compared to the Google alternative, the Echo Dot price can't be beat, and connecting to speakers is a great advantage. I'm sure the ""Skills"" the Echo Dot can do and Alexa's knowledge will only continue to grow.","January 13, 2017"

Ok, not really, but she does answer just about anything I throw at her, and she plays me music and turns my lights on and off. It's like having the smartest butler ever working for you.

It's posh, trust me.I'm impressed with the mic range - I can talk to her from other rooms without issues. Every once in a while, she tries to answer a question from the TV, but then we just laugh and go back to drinking wine.I really do like the Echo - it's small, can be portable (with accessories), answers those ""who was it that starred in Perfect Strangers"" questions that pop up, and can help you substitute eggs in a recipe in a pinch.","February 28, 2017"

Some helpful and some not so helpful to some that are unknown or that she can't answer or understand.  I'm sure she'll get better and better with updates in time.From homework, to cooking, to everyday life, traffic, stores, weather, music and silliness, we've been able to turn to her for some help and entertainment.We've uploaded some of the ""skills"" but can't seem to remember what they're all called to access them so they're not used very often.There's been a few times that she doesn't perk up when we talk to her but other than that, even with a Bluetooth speaker not too far away, she usually hears us over some loud music.We're planning on getting a smart hub or some other add ons to work with her but for now, she is low key and takes up minimal space.I am still debating whether or not to get a few more.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Major Alexa to Ground Control","Being a previous X10 user, was looking for a better and more up to date way of controlling my lights and other devices.  Amazon Echo provided this control point at a price point that made it economical to place devices in multiple rooms.  I coupled it with the Samsung SmartThings hub and control devices from GE, Cree and GoControl as well as my Harmony device used to control my Entertainment center.  Alexa was able to recognize and control the lighting devices but for the Harmony devices you need to ask Alexa to ask Harrmony to perform an action and this appears to be the case for a lot of other add-ons where you need to remember the service name to issue a command.  My biggest disappointment was that Alexa is 100% reliant on its Internet connection and connection to the Amazon servers.  If your Internet connection is down, or the servers are down then Alexa is about as useful as lead boots at a swimming competition.  In the 4 weeks since I deployed, my Internet has been down once and the Amazon servers unresponsive making Alexa useless to control my devices or even set a wake up alarm.  Would be nice if a set of base commands were installed on the device that allowed it to function with locally connected devices without having to talk to the Mother Ship first.","March 17, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Rick C.","Amazing for its price; a few deficiences though","This is truly an amazing little thing. I have an Amazon Echo, and both have pretty identical technical capabilities. The Dot has two big advantages -- it retails for $50 rather than $129, and it can be linked into a stereo system via bluetooth or direct cable (I use it with Bluetooth). The main disadvantage this has standalone is that the speakers are not nearly as good as the Echo's, music sounds more or less like a cheap radio, but not so much the problem when you have it linked to home system or a good bluetooth speaker. The Echo series does have many wonderful skills which you can find all about elsewhere, but I'll mention some surprising deficiencies for the series. The biggest surprise is the inability to directly wake to music. You can only wake to any of a selectable series of alarms. So they can't really replace a clock radio. They can wake you, they can play music... you can even set a sleep timer while playing music. But no music or news to awaken you. A minor annoyance for me is that though it can play Spotify playlists, you can't *shuffle* play them (the Echo ignores the word ""shuffle"" in ""shuffle play my 'favorites' playlist). I have a big playlist of favorite tunes which is not fun when it starts over with the same one every time. I also wish that, along with its timers and alarms, it could issue a verbal reminder of something. You can say, ""Alexa, set an alarm for tomorrow morning at 7:30am"" or ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes,"" but I'd love it if you could say, ""Alexa, set a reminder tomorrow at 7:30am that I have to go to the dentist,"" or ""Alexa, remind me to turn down the oven in 30 minutes"" (night before last, both of us were cooking different things and getting confused as to which of three timers was for doing what). Still, would buy again; would get for anyone on my Christmas list who isn't afraid of a little online set-up that I'd be willing to spend $50 on.","November 18, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","T. Bramhall","More than a toy","I could hardly wait for my new toy to arrive.I had ordered the Dot about a week before it came out, and the day that I received notification that it was out for delivery, I waited with eager anticipation.I have to admit, I hate that Amazon has started using USPS more than UPS. With UPS, I'd have my package in the morning. With USPS, I don't receive it until around 4 or 5 pm. But, finally it was here and I quickly unpacked it and downloaded the app on my phone.It took a little time to set up the app, connecting Spotify, adding a code so Alexa couldn't just order anything she heard on the TV, which I'd read was a problem with earlier versions. Once I got it set up, there was an update, but that took almost no time. Then I paired it with my Bose Soundlink Mini, a ""toy"" I'd gotten this summer.Pairing was quick and easy, although one note I should mention is that if you pair several items (phone, computer, Echo Dot, etc.), you may have a problem when the speaker receives info from more than one connection. If the Dot doesn't seem to be working with the speaker, make sure that another device isn't also trying to play - even if your computer or phone is muted but would be making sound otherwise, it can claim priority on the speaker (my only complaint with the SoundLInk, but I mention it here because I thought my Dot was broken when I couldn't get it to play).For the first few days, the Dot was mostly used for music. I love being able to listen to background music when I feel like it, exactly the music I want to hear at the volume I want it, and then being able to pause or stop it when I want.But on the third day, my lights arrived. I live in an old house with weird wiring in some rooms. The overhead light in our bedroom has no switch, which makes you wonder what the people who put it in were thinking. For the first time since we bought the house, the bedroom light is actually useful. ""Alexa, turn on our bedroom light."" ""Turning on our bedroom light.""All in all, for $50, the Dot is everything I hoped it would be, and I'm still just discovering its capabilities. There are additions I'd love to see (integrating with Apple apps would be wonderful), but so far I'm very impressed, and this is a device that I know I'll be using every day.","October 31, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Heather","Love my Echo Dot!","LOVE this product. We have Alexa paired with a number of smart switches and plugs and light bulbs in our house and being able to voice-control everything makes our lives so much easier and it feels so cool to have a smart house. Alexa plays our holiday music at our parties, can change the Nest thermostat upstairs to a more comfortable setting when we are downstairs, helps us with our daily commute by letting us know if there is traffic, and even lets me know how to dress based on the weather/outside temp info she can provide. We use her to play soothing thunderstorm sounds at night, and to catch the scores of the game if we missed it. A truly invaluable tool. I have one for my first floor and one for my second, and now a bunch of my family members are ordering them as well. The dot works perfectly well for us, and I'm not sure what differences there are between it and the regular echo, other than the speaker, but I find that the dot's speaker works just fine for our needs. We rarely have issues with Alexa understanding our commands, with the only instance when we hosted a Christmas party and there were so many voices around, I'm not sure she could easily distinguish the commands. I simply moved a little closer and spoke a little louder and more clearly and she picked up and followed the command easily. The Alexa app is constantly being updated and new skills are always being added. I now use use Alexa and the TrackR app to find my phone around the house, and Alexa can check local movie times as well.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","JH","Better value than Echo for casual user","Let me start by saying that I had purchased an Echo about 2 months ago, I did not have a great experience with the Echo as it lost connection with certain songs from my Amazon prime account and Pandora.  Timers, weather, etc seemed to work ok. I had purchased at Best Buy, but even though associated with my account was unable to write a review which would have been only 2 stars.  I returned that device to BB as I am unsure if it was my internet, amazons servers or a defective device, as a note I can stream Netflix and Hulu on several devices w/o issue, however even w/o any other internet activity the Echo would stop on certain songs. I gave the device about a week and several conversations to Amazon TS w/o any improvement prior to return.For the Echo,I had it located in the kitchen/family area. I really liked the ability to pull up the weather, set a timer, some current new on request and ability to integrate with Prime Music and Pandora. I thought the sound quality was pretty good for what it is, granted it is not a complete surround sound stereo system.  I would have kept the Echo had it not been for songs stalling.I probably would not have purchased another Alexa device had the price been $170+ but at $50 I decided I would bite again and give it another try and am glad that I did.  It does all of the things I liked in the Echo, but does not have any dropped songs or stalls so far.  So I am going to assume something was wrong w/ the original Echo I had or Amazon ironed out some server issues.The smaller size does allow for hiding it better, although you do still want it to be able to hear you and you it.The sound is more than acceptable for my purposes with plenty of volume.  That said, it lacks bass compared to the Echo and you will not hear it as well if your TV is loud or a bunch of kids are over running around. I have not tried to connect it to an external speaker or stereo system.For the casual user that just wants weather updates, the time, a timer, a little music and is not an audiophile this device is smaller and far less expensive than the echo and can perform all of the same functions as far as I know.  For the person that just wants more bass, the Echo may satisfy your needs w/o extra cables etc, but if you are really picky about sound you are still going to want to connect to a different speaker or stereo, and the dot allows that.Also, at $50 one is not as concerned about kids playing with it or it getting knocked over etc.At the $50 price point, if you have amazon prime I feel this is an excellent purchase.  I gave 4 stars and not 5 more for my issues I had with my Echo and Amazons customer service than for the dot itelf.  I kind of feel that the issue I had with the Echo could potentially be encountered by some w/ the Dot as I really never determined why the Echo had stall issues.","October 24, 2016"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Chad","Great little product in need of better search, buy the speaker with it.","First off, you will need the speaker so buy it. I wanted to Y this off with an adapter and run both my computer and this through the same speakers, but that didn't work so I ended up buying speakers. The other issue I have is that the microphones don't seem to pick up quite as well as my Echo. Still great mind you, but I notice that several times I've had to speak up. But with Echo I don't get that.The main flaw with Alexa continues to be its reliance on Bing as its search engine. Amazon really needs to either create its own search algorithm for Alexa, switch to Google, or at the very least allow customers (the ones that are always right) to pick which of the two they want. I've performed experiments where I've asked Alexa and not gotten an answer then used OK Google with the same keywords and gotten exactly what I wanted. A perfect example was last night. I asked when the polls closed in my state. I named the state. Alexa couldn't tell me but instead said to go to the link that it placed in my app...well...first off...that's no good because I'm asking Echo and not my phone. When I did grab my phone and asked OK Google the exact question it gave me the answer I was looking for without any issues. I'm tired of Alexa either not knowing or putting a link in the app. I can tell you now I've never, not one single time, looked at that link in the app because I don't have it with me. The entire idea of a voice activated friend in every room is to get answers whenever and wherever you want. I don't want to carry my phone around the house with me.All that said, I still enjoy having this device. I own Echo, this echo dot, and another will arrive this afternoon (literally). So I'm not knocking the product entirely. It's massively expandable using IFTT and skills but it's core function, that of an assistant, lacks and will lack until they get better search.","November 9, 2016"

The big sister came first, at Christmas time, while little sister is only a couple of weeks old.  A great invention, and very useful.  We love being able to add items to our shopping list that is then available via iPhone when shopping.","March 9, 2017"

Got my dot in a perfectly nice and sealed package. Functions like it's suppose to and looks great. I do wish they had better search functions like looking for plane tickets or bus/train schedules nearby. Their list of partnered devices is great but not the best. Commands not as flexible as the Google Home. Certain commands are set in stone and it's hard to work around. But overall its amazing! Just missing some functions.","December 2, 2016"

However, the sound through the 3.5mm jack to a pair of FOSTEX monitor speakers is more than adequate to my failing ears.I purchased an echo and a dot to keep me company in different rooms of the apartment. It will read some Kindle books in its synthesized voice, as well as Audible audio books. Have just begun experimenting with Wemo wifi sockets to control lights. Now that I can say, ""Alexa, living room on!,"" and ""Alexa, lights off!"" I'm hooked.","December 1, 2016"

This major glitch defeats the convenience of a voice control. Very disappointing.","December 19, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","G. Stapleton","Great product","I use this anytime I am in the kitchen for a long period of time. My other main echo is in my bedroom. The key to this type of technology is to just use it. It's easy for one not to find a need for a product like this. Mainly because they have it on their phone, which they don't use either. I use mine for any and everything. I ask the weather before I leave work, I am constantly asking fo the time, I listen to my Spotify through it and the list goes on. I even download extra things that the echo offers through the website to add even more complexity to it.So, buy it and use it.","March 4, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","DTG3","Great for your bedside table","Had an echo, and used it in my bedroom for ambiance and as an alarm clock and for audiobooks occasionally.  I didn't like moving it back and forth from the living room when I had guests over (where it gets a lot of use and attention), so I purchased this so I wouldn't have to move it and so that I wouldn't have to give up on an alarm clock in the bedroom.So now my echo dot sits by the bed.  I don't have the same bass that I have with the full-sized echo, but that's alright. This thing does what it does well and is great for audiobooks and ambient music, but would probably fall short if you're a big audiophile. For the cost of a mid-high range alarm clock, I've got that functionality and an assistant to tell me the weather and play music while I'm getting out of bed in the morning, and I still have my echo in the living room for parties, music while we cook/play board games, and what else have you.","January 21, 2017"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","I like the Echo Dot","I like the Echo Dot.  I already had a Bose speaker to hook it up to so I didn't need the full Echo.  It is useful to ask questions about the weather or to turn on our hue lights and other lights hooked up to our WeMo plugs.  I only give it 4 stars because Amazon needs to improve the number of ""skills"" it has and to partner with more home automation companies like Sonos.  Its ability to interact with Nest and our separate Honeywell Wifi thermostat are limited at best.  Also the AI could use some tweaking... like this morning I kept asking about how windy it was going to be or what the projected wind speed would for the day (it was supposed to be very windy) and Alexa kept just telling me the forecast over and over.  Obviously she understands I am asking about the weather (""wind"" apparently = ""weather"" to her) but does not understand that I am asking particular information.  Other times she will directly respond like when I asked specifically if there was any snow in the forecast.  If she can't answer it that's fine, but she should say so instead of just repeating the same answer.Again, its a work in progress and I am sure it will get better as time does on.  I would recommend you do your research and figure out the home automation products that appear to work best with Alexa/Echo before you pull the trigger.","December 16, 2016"

I was looking into home automation with Siri compatibility.  I have Hue and Lutron bridge that works with Echo Dot.  I use it daily and works great.  However, some how and some way, Echo Dot loses connection and reconnects.  I am not sure what it is but 80% of the time, it's connected.  On skills, I have added few skills for information on news, weather, reading ebook and such.  It comes very handy while I need a fast update.

This one is located in our bathroom, and our full size Echo is located in our kitchen.

My recommendation is to hook it up to another speaker so the sound quality is better, as it is a truly terrible speaker that's built in - I'm sure as a reason to buy their more expensive models.Seems to work good.  My only real complaint is that it has a few false positives, sometimes responding to the TV if audio says anything remotely close to ""alexa"".  Granted you can change the trigger word to something else, but it's just worth noting.","March 31, 2017"

I have to turn it up full blast in order to hear it. You might as well use the speaker on your device because it has more volume than the echo does. I wanted to return it but I waited to long to decide if I liked it or not.  My return date was in February. It's hard to get it to pair with a blue tooth device.

It's next to useless for any kind of internet search, I asked for a specific crab cake recipe and it ""couldn't find the answer to that question."" More often than not, the thing cannot find an answer to my basic, generic questions. Also, consider buying a battery so that the device can become portable (as long as you're connected to with-fi). I'm not returning this b/ c it's not that expensive and don't want to go through the hassle. A friend said Google Home was a better choice for her.","February 14, 2017"

I use it the most for time, timers, stopwatch, weather, shopping list, music and to find my phone.  I have also paired it with a TP Link so that i can turn my bedside table light on/off instead of getting out of bed and walking across the room when i'm ready to go to bed or need a light at night.If it wouldn't be for the stupid skills that need to be enabled for every little thing, it would be 5 stars.  But who wants to find skills and then have to recall the name so that you can direct Alexa to use that skill.  Bad move Amazon.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","David Ashley","Amazing Value, Amazing Sound From Something Roughly the Size of a Hockey Puck","I ordered four of these as gifts, at about $40 each (on sale).  At the time I ordered, I already owned two Amazon Echos.These have most of the significant functionality of the Amazon Echo, but at a far lower price.  Functionality included:  WiFi, 7 microphones with very good voice recognition, LED ring with many segments (a pretty good light show), speaker.  Functionality not included:  won't function as a Bluetooth speaker, does not have volume adjustment ring (has buttons instead).I was very pleased.  Out of a slightly-larger-than-a-hockey-puck-sized device, I expected terrible sound.  But the sound is completely adequate, both in volume and quality.  It is perfectly adequate for listening to music in your kitchen or listening to audiobooks in your bedroom.  It is louder and clearer than I expected (but of course not as good as the Echo).  And of course since it has audio output (AUX plus Bluetooth), you can really crank up the volume with the right secondary device.Amazing functionality at that price point.  Amazing sound from something roughly the size of a hockey puck.This device is five stars, especially at the $40 or $50 price point.","December 26, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Breana","5 dots and 1 Amazon Alexa Household Review","We have four 2nd generation dots, one 1st generation dot, and 1 Amazon echo.  So it's safe to say, we're an Alexa household. :) I love the dots, here are some of the ways we use them most frequently.In the bedroom, living room, and office we use them to turn on and off the lights. We live in an older house, where not many rooms have overhead lighting... so this was huge.  I know it's so lazy, but it's soooo nice being able to get under the sheets and then just say ""Alexa, Bedroom Lights Off"".  And in the morning it helps us wake up, turning the lights on from bed, then actually getting out of bed :).As a white noise machine.  Every night we ask Alexa to play white noise (we found a sound we like the most).  But we also use her for classical and spa music whenever we're working at home.To check the weather.To check my commute.To check scores of games.To create a shopping list.To set timers/alarms.To tell us a joke.Occasionally to have someone to yell at.  When you each have an hour plus commute and stressful jobs, sometimes it's nice to be able to snap at someone but not feel guilty about it.To listen to music. While cooking, showering, or really anything. Research has proven households who listen to music are happier.  And we actually listen to music with Alexa because it's so easy.With all that being said, I love my Alexa devices... but there are still a few things I don't like.The white dots don't have a white cord or top (or bottom for that matter).  So if you're looking for the white to blend in with your white furniture... it won't work all that well. (See picture)The dots/Amazon Alexa are NOT connected.  I guess this is great that we can play different music in different rooms... but when the kitchen timer is going off and I'm sitting in the living room--it's annoying hearing ""no timer is set"" when you're trying to turn it off.Sometimes the bedroom Alexa picks us up when we're in the kitchen.  Which drives us bonkers when it picked us up setting a timer (see above.)Alexa still has a lot of learning to do.  She still doesn't understand many of our questions (things that should be able to be answered by Wikipedia, etc.)","February 24, 2017"

And sometimes, for no reason that I can tell, when I give a command the blue ring flashes once and it does nothing (during these times, NO voice commands work). Unplugging and replugging to reset it does not help at all. But then later, again for no reason that I can tell, voice commands work again.

She is now my alarm clock, she plays music, and I used her a lot for new words as my talking dictionary.Remember the days where you have to turn on your computer and Google something?  Well, now you can ask Alexa even if you just woke up from your bed like as her ""Alexa, what time is it?""  You can even set an alarm for Alexa to wake you up in half an hour, or even play your favorite music.  I think what I like most about Alexa is that she has made my life that much easier especially when my hands are tied and I don't have a set of hands to turn on the lights, she can do that for me with a ""say a command!""

I love everything that it can do... unfortunately it's going to require that I spend more money to update my light bulbs, thermostat, etc to experience the whole ""smart home' thing.But we LOVE the idea of being able to create a shopping list and just add to it thruout the week; no more getting to Costco only to discover that we left our list at home.

The Dot not only works well at controlling appliances, but it also is a hoot for getting answers about other things. The weather, my upcoming schedule, the grocery list, who was Aaron Burr. She also tells jokes!It was very easy to set up (you'll need wifi and your wifi password). We paired ours with the TP-Link Smart Plugs and have since been learning about the many things that Alexa can do. My husband thought it was a waste of money (geez, what's wrong with plugging the mechanical timers on the lights?), but has warmed up to the whole idea tremendously. Our next purchase will be replacement wall switches that can link to Alexa to control the ceiling fans and lights, and most likely a thermostat as well.This would be a great gift to an older homeowner, especially someone with mobility issues, because it's all controlled by voice.","December 3, 2016"

I have not used the direct line in so I'm not sure how well that works. And without a doubt it truly is smart and constantly learning...as long as you help it.

I got it as an open box condition for $40, did not want to pay the full $50 since I knew it sells for $40 during the black friday and prime day sale. Its been worth the penny since then.

The ability to task the time without looking at your phone.3. The ability to do currency conversions.4. The ability to play prime music along with media controls..5. Ability to keep reminders on the fly.6. Perform calculations.7. Play news8. Trivia10. Smart Home functions.These are just the fraction of functions that I use. What makes it different from Siri, Cortana and Google Now is the fact that this has an unidirectional mike which makes it hear across the room. So even though it might not be as advanced as google now, it gets the basics right, which is the most important thing.

Sometimes it plays just my music and sometimes prime. Voice recognition is good, not great. Google is better. When an internet search is required, performance is poor. Not sure if that Alexa or the Bing search engine but results are not very good. Alexa frequently appears to crash. Probably too many people using. Trying to get nearest restaurant bar etc is totally inaccurate. Locations are miles further away. No way to custumize TuneIn so frequently get wrong status. Does not get logic right unless you use exact wording. I have two and both drop the Bluetooth connection occasionally. It's not the speaker as it's rock solid to my phone.","November 2, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Billy B","Simply amazing","I was a very early adopter of the original Echo and wrote Amazon how they needed an Echo device that allowed Bluetooth OUT or wired audio OUT.  Yet I sat on this little gem without ordering one for a long time.  Finally pulled the trigger and am very glad I did.  Great device to hook up to your home audio system or Bluetooth speakers.  I have mine on a Bose Wave Radio in the Bedroom.  It's an amazing device that is my alarm clock, music and news source, and music entertainment.  It's simply amazing.","October 25, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Ash585","Great Product at a Great Price","There are some great in-depth reviews already posted, but I mirror the general consensus that this is a great product. I purchased as a gift for someone that wants to easily stream music. This is very easy to use (set-up is simple via your smartphone) and so far no problems with Alexa recognizing music selections. One thing I haven't found mentioned in a review- If you're looking for 'pop' music, Alexa is fantastic at finding songs. If you're looking for 'classical,' or anything performed by specific orchestras or musicians, she's not as good at finding those yet. She'll find a version of Beethoven 6, but you might have a hard time asking for a specific orchestra playing it.","November 25, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","J4","Actually a really convenient item to have","Having Alexa is actually more useful than I thought it would be.  I bought one just to try out and see what it's like.  Having the ability to just ask a question without picking up a phone or device is great.  If you have a prime account and have amazon music it's even better, I find myself more often then not just asking Alexa to play a station or a song and because it's linked to my prime account the music plays without me having to go through my phone.  I was very surprised at how decent the speaker on the echo dot is, I was expecting a crappy small speaker that was really going to rely on connecting to a Bluetooth speaker or physical connection.  The device works really well as a standalone speaker for a decent size room.  I wouldn't trade in your nice speakers over it but if you have 2/3 dots around the house it actually works fine by itself.  I never would have foreseen myself buying multiple but after having one I can see the use for having one on each floor of my house, as a music player, as a device for asking the weather, asking questions, setting alarms, adding things to a list, making purchases, using it to control Alexa enabled devices.  It's definitely worth it for the price.","December 16, 2016"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","IMHO","Good... But skip the Bose","This is an updated review.  My first Echo Dot was a failure, but the replacement is good.  My full size Echo has a better sound quality, but this little guy does the job and is small enough to sit in the kitchen and not get in the way! ***UPDATE*** I purchased the Bose Soundlink Mini 2 for my Echo Dot.  The sound is OK, HOWEVER, I also own a full size Echo and that sounds BETTER than the Echo Dot with the Bose Soundlink AND for less money!  That said, if you are focused on sound quality, it is my honest opinion that you would be better served with the full size Echo over the Dot with the Bose Mini 2.Here is my initial review of the Echo:  I tried to get a video of this, but for some reason it won't load.  I'll try again later.  The dot works similar to the full size echo, although the sound quality is not as good.  The reason for two stars is that the dot frequently drops the internet connection and also seems to have a defective processing chip or something because when I leave it alone for more than half an hour and then speak to it, the response is a red ring and the comment of ""I'm having trouble understanding right now, please try again later"".  Later will only happen if I unplug it and re-plug it in again.  I called technical support, and they are sending a replacement so I'll review my replacement and  update this review as this unfolds.  It is worth mention that I LOVE my full size Echo, and am still hopeful that the Dot will work.","November 16, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","The Helpful Dad","Echo is great for streaming music on your existing stereo system with great range for control!","Overall we're impressed. The main reason I got it was to attach it to my existing stereo in order to stream music on zone 2 for my patio/bedroom/bath. I was just about to buy a Sonos Connect to do this (for over $300) but decided to try the Echo Dot first. I am so glad I did. The Echo does does a great job for this task - it connects to my stereo well and what's great is that Echo uses WIFI not bluetooth so the range to connect to it from your phone is much bigger. We can be on the opposite side of the house and use the phone to control Alexa and change the music.Tip: I used an existing audio cable to attach to Echo Dot so you do not necessarily need to buy the extra audio cable if you already have one.Tip: once you use voice control to activate Alexa to play music the first time, then you no longer need to keep using your voice to play music. You can just use the app on your phone and be in a different room. This is great. We can relax in the bedroom controlling Alexa while the Echo is in the living room.The only thing I don't like is that there are minimal/almost no physical controls and the app is sometimes slow to use to control Alexa.","January 8, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","T.W","pretty cool","I was skeptical at first. I loved the concept of just saying a command and having it done without getting up was a huge plus.. I also knew it was always going to be on. So i actually wrote a list of what I actually wanted to do with it, after completing the list i then decided what room of the house I would place it in. My uses for it are for music, alarms, weather and news briefings and maybe an occasional (although corny) joke or two. I also added Unlimited music to it for 3.99 (a steal). After determining my uses I decided to put it in my bedroom because I don't have a ""smart home"" and since I do most of my work in my room it was the most ideal place for it.Needless to say it does everything i've asked it to (for the most part)  i just wish it would search for answers to questions instead of ""i don't understand the question"". if they fix this easy 5 stars product.","March 21, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","K. Biegler","'I loved her'.","Well what can you say? Ok, One day I told Alexa that, 'I loved her' ... she answered back ... 'That's nice, Thank You' ... so I guess we're going to only be 'just friends' :-DIt's a pretty nice small device, if you are looking for audiophile fantastic ... no ... but for the nightstand and controlling Nest and hopefully lights as well as streaming music it's a pretty nice addition to the home. Looking forward to the new battery pack when it arrives and hopefully they are on schedule with teaching her to control my Sonos for now though streaming radio stations from around the country via the web or Pandora we are loving it ... getting weather, news briefs and setting alarms with simple voice commands is pretty nice.

I ask Alexa questions and she's great at giving me the answers.  I would recommend this to anyone.  The ""skills"" you can get are endless. Just look on the Alexa app or amazon.  I haven't found a question she can't answer.  This would be great for elderly people or disabled people who have trouble walking.  I have mine set up so all I say is ""Alexa, turn off the lights.""

While playing games we asked her questions, we set alarms for food we were cooking, asked for recipes, how long to cook our prime rib, etc... Now I'm home with her and she's been a busy girl.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Patty Duke","My life saver","Love my Echo Dot! I wish I never realized how helpful this little gadget would be to me. I added the Buddy app to my Echo and I'm so glad I did. I was working around the house and when I bent over to pick up a basket of laundry and my back went out. I couldn't move at all, couldn't get to my phone. It was horrible! I asked Alexa to get help and she was able to send a message to all the family members I had in my contact list. My mom got the message and showed up at my house and was able to get me to the hospital. It's hard telling how many hours I would have been stuck like that in pain if I didn't have my Alexa.

We started with the original Echo and loved it.  The original seems the best of the three.  I have it in the home office.  We followed up with a 1st gen Dot when they became available and set it up with a bluetooth speaker in our bedroom.  The third we placed in our kitchen.The first Echo seems most responsive.  It immediately answers questions and requests and the speaker is actually quite good.  However, I think it might be location and placement.  It sits on the counter and there are few ambient noises around.The second in our bedroom works fairly well. We probably use it the most.  The speaker seems a little ""tinny"". We hooked it up to a small bluetooth speaker and it does well.  My wife relocated it to the top of a display cabinet so Alexa struggles to hear there a bit.Our newest addition is the 2nd gen Dot and it was placed in the kitchen.  We have been slower to adopt it to kitchen tasks only because it is habit to set timers and such in there manually.  Adding items to the shopping list is really cool.  If they can add a feature to allow multiple items at a time it would be great.  We do use it a lot for music, internet radio and news etc.  The kitchen Dot does struggle a little with ambient sound and I have moved it around the kitchen to get better responses.None of the Dots conflict with the other and setup for all were very easy.We have just started collecting Alexa enabled outlets and have started automating some lighting.  We have a Wemo and now a handful of TP Link to experiment with.  All fairly easy to install.I plan to purchase one more Dot for my garage workshop.  I want to use it to automate some workshop and yard lighting as well as have hands free music etc available.  We will see how the noise there affects it.","November 28, 2016"

My brother-in-law is a new gadget person and has everything but he didn't have this and he had not even seen it.  I couldn't have bought a better present for him.

She can't answer a lot of questions but she functions as a calculator, dictionary, timer, alarm clock, music streamer, and her skills are like apps on your phone and she has a few good ones. Overall, worth the price. Thanks Amazon, cool deal!Surprisingly, her speaker is nice and smooth sounding, although there is practically no bass at all. There is clear midrange and highs are present so the music is enjoyable through her. The speaker is on the bottom, interestingly done, but if you sit her on the bed you can't hear her well. =)","March 6, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Matt [Eight-Six]","Our home is host to products like WeMo, and Nest","We currently use two of these at home, and gave one to our parents to try out too.Our home is host to products like WeMo, and Nest, and the Echo Dot effortlessly detects and and communicates with these smart devices well. I would like to see further support for some devices (I know Sonos is coming) but the sooner the better in my opinion. We also use Google Homes and while the Homes are nice, the Dot seems to be more on point with the devices it talks to.On occasion Alexa will answer 'OK' and not execute the command given, making asking her twice to do the action a little bit of a nuisance. It's a small issue but likely a problem for that of the devices (like WeMo) that she attempts to talk to.I also don't like how Amazon works with IFTTT. Having to setup 'trigger' is annoying when the competition will execute the command without saying 'sending that to IFTTT.' To me it makes it less awesome and seamless.Example if using IFTTT: (I'm Home is the command for turning the lights/thermostat on)""Alexa Trigger I'm Home"" and she responds ""Sending that to IFTTT""Using the competition:""OK Google I'm home"" and hearing ""Welcome Home!"" is a much nicer experience.Now it is fair to say that you can setup groups in the Alexa App, to do something similar (not using IFTTT), but the reason I mention this stuff is because some things will require support from IFTTT, and the way they work together (at the time of this review) is annoying.I also recommend using an external speaker for her to communicate through. The added 3.5 aux audio jack was a nice inclusion for the Dot. I assume they knew this would be something people wanted and unlike the competitions sub-par speaker and no DIRECT audio out, I find this a nice thing to have. Both dots utilize a much better external speaker, and sit on top of said speakers. This adds to the better experience listening to music, and hearing her more clearly.The sooner it supports my Sonos, the better. :)I'd recommend this if you have interest in trying out home automation. It is great, with some minor set backs (likely just personal grievances subjective to my own tastes)","January 7, 2017"

I love being able to use the Amazon Echo for voice control of my living room lights and other compatible devices (i.e. my Nest thermostat).  The cost of the Amazon Echo was the only thing holding me back from putting one in other parts of the house.  As soon as I saw the Echo Dot (2nd gen) advertised for sale I immediately ordered 3 of them to put in other parts of my house.  I already had a good speaker system in my bedroom so I added a Dot there.  I put another in my wife's office and attached a set of Bose speakers and I put one in the Kitchen (no external speakers but that one is not for listening to music).All 3 Dots were incredibly easy to set up and all are working perfectly.  The only difference I noticed about them compared to the Amazon Echo (besides the sound quality) is the dots seem to take slightly longer to turn my lights on and off.  I am not 100% sure they take longer but it seems like they are just a bit slower but not enough to really make a difference.","October 24, 2016"

While the Dot may not have the sound output of the larger original Echo, the Bluetooth and wired options more than make up for it. My Dot is paired with a Marshall Kilburn and the sound is fantastic and LOUD. While I was satisfied with the  original device's sound quality, I wanted the option of a little more punch. This combo certainly fits the bill. The Dot also quickly pairs with my other speakers and headphones, but it's pretty much always paired with the Kilburn now. I have had no problems with the Dot failing to respond. The only problem came when I changed the ""activate"" word to ""Echo"". The Dot seemed to hear that quite often from the police scanner located nearby. Made for some interesting commands when I checked the Alexa app. How could Alexa not understand, ""about you have a girl bell about barack operator travel ninety five stop.""? What's not clear? I suspect the two syllable ""activate"" word is at fault here. When I changed it to ""Amazon"" the accidental queries stopped.

You can ask for recipes, you can list a few ingreds in your fridge and ask what CAN you make, you can add to your google calendar (it wont alert you if you have an appointment which is kind of crappy)My ONLY complaint is this: Periodically I have to ask alexa to repeat because not all of her sentences come through clear.

However, it seems she is getting better at understanding what I tell her once I use that command more often.Overall, I am still very happy with the purchase of the echo dot and would definitely recommend it for the value that it brings to my daily life.Oct 2016: This is my first Echo and I have to say it is one o the best valued purchased that I have made in my entire life.  I have been wanting to get an Echo for sometime now, but have been put off by the price of the original Amazon Echo. As soon as this affordable model came out I knew I had to get it and I had one unit on preorder. When I finally received this unit last Thursday, I was suprised at how compact in size it is. After plugging it in and setting it up, which took about 1-2 minutes I immediately fell in love with it.  The setup process was extremely straight forward and quick. I already had a bose campanion sets of speaks so I just used the AUX out cable to plug the echo into my speakers. However even without the use of an outside set of speakers, I thought the echo dot still sounded relatively decent even for playing music. Alexa was able to recognize pretty much everything that I asked her to do such as turning on the light, playing music, asking about the weather, the news etc. Even when I am outside the room, about 10 feet away from her she can easily hear my normal speaking voice. The only time that she has trouble hearing me is when I have her playing really loud music, which is to expected considering I would not be able to hear someone talking in a loud room. She also has the ability to learn your speech pattern and voice the more often you use her, so she can better recognize and understand what it is that you want her to do. I also love the set alarm feature on her, I can simply tell her to set an alarm for 10 minutes or set an alarm for 8 am the next day without having to go onto my phone in the middle of the night. Another awesome feature about her is definitely how she can control smart light bulbs. For someone that is lazy as I am when getting out of bed at night to turn off the light, it is such a blessing to be able to simply say ""Alexa turn off the light."" Another neat feature about her is that lately I have been having insomnia due to a big state board examination coming up, so I have been using her to help me sleep by playing relaxing ambiance. At the moment, you also change her name from Alexa to either Echo or Amazon. I currently have her under Echo in my room and Alexa in the living room since sometimes when I am calling to Alexa, the echo in the living room would pick it up as well. After getting my 1st unit, I ended up getting the 5 for 6 echo deal as I wanted another one in my living room as well and I also wanted to give some away as gifts to my family and friends. For $250 for 6 units, plus 5% cash back from discover credit card and the $5 gift card balance after reloading $100, each unit ended up costing me $38.75 which is just awesome value for all of the features that she can provide.","October 26, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","ElEcho","WORTH. EVERY. PENNY!!","Sometimes I buy stuff not because I want or need it, but because of the deal of it all. This is one of those times. At $50, I figured I’d see what Alexa/Echo dot is all about. I mean, it's only the price of a bluetooth speaker, but it serves a lot of purposes. If it didn't work well, I probably would have still given it halfway decent reviews simply because of the innovation at price factor. What I’m trying to say is, I unboxed this thing with the lowest of expectations.Mind blown, guys… Mind blown. For $50 this thing controls my thermostat, my car, plays music when I need it, gives me a rundown of the news, reads me my Kindle books, could order stuff for me (but I don’t use this feature), etc. I live in a 4 level townhouse and sometimes need something from my car in the garage but have my keys on the 4th floor. Alexa, open car door. So far, I haven’t paired it with any speakers. I just use it as is, and the speakers are strong enough. What pleases me the most is it’s all cloud based and will continue to improve as time goes on. Skills will continue to be introduced, making it even more awesome. I’ll be buying a few more.","November 1, 2016"

I have bought more and find she works so well, I'm now beginning Ning to look at adding some smart home items.I don't give her a hardy workout. But I do use the timer alert, weather, new flash, Prime music, pandora music, place an order and a couple other things.At times I spend time at our other home alone. I get a chuckle when I say, Alexa good night, good morning, or Thank you and she responds.I don't listen to music at a very high volume so The speaker is a decent quality.  I can't speak to how it would sound it is was up on a higher level. Considering if we will add a blue tooth speaker.I have heard the Big Alexa has an awesome sound.I do wish she worked with Apple Calendar, not just Google but we will see what the future holds there.I also wish, because I often babysit my grandchildren, that Prime Music had little kids music station.I think those fun songs could/would be educational and a fun way interact as the oldest is 2.I look forward to her new skills as she grows up.","December 5, 2016"

I love my new Amazon dot, this product has only been with me for a few days and already made my life easier. The day i got it i was having a birthday party and was able ask Alexa to play music for me while i cooked all day and prepped my house. During the party i had her bumping party music and it was great because it allowed me to release my phone of its usual duties of playing music. No more walking out of the room and losing Bluetooth connection and the music dropping from the party.The Amazon dot really is amazing, i ask Alexa so many different questions or play games on her when I'm bored. I cannot wait to get some smart home products and let her control my lights and other electronics. I hope the skills improve further in the future to allow a user to do even more. For the price this is really a great piece of technology that will be extremely helpful to you. Alexa is like my newest roommate and she is great. i would highly recommend this product to anyone, its great for both kids and adults, Alexa is the future in smart home technology.","December 5, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Real Story","Maybe it's how I use it","I've been using Siri and Cortana faithfully. I'm probably one of the few prople that use them all day everyday. So, I thought the dot would round out my usage by adding them where the other assistants were not. I found Alexa couldn't even tell me how many kilobytes to a megabyte. I have a slew of questions that show on the app correctly but sadly she only answered very few. I have 30 days with BestBuy to return them, so I'll give it a few more tries but it's not looking so good.","April 13, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Josh","Such a great piece of technology","Such a great piece of technology.  My one Dot can hear me anywhere in my condo.  Music sounds good from such a small speaker, I would recommend this one over the full size Echo unless you're really into music and don't have another sound system to plug the Echo into.I'm slightly disappointed with the Hue light control.  I can't get the Dot to change the color of the lights, only on, off, and %.What I'd really love to see would be a device that combines the always on voice control of the Dot with a Fire TV.  I know the Fire TV has voice control, but you need to use the remote or your phone to do it.","December 12, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Kristin R.","Amazing!!!!  We bought a second!","This thing is amazing!  We love it so much that we actually bought a second.  The first is in our living room which my husband hooked up to our stereo and speakers.  The other is in our bedroom.  (just by itself)  The echo dot has a built in speaker which actually does get pretty loud and is perfect for a room. We have ""Alexa"" play music, tell us the weather, set alarms for us, and tell us what movies are playing at the theater. She even tells me how many steps I have on my Fitbit, and plays rock, paper, scissors. (I often lose)  It'll also read your books aloud from your Kindle as well.For $50.00 it's great! I highly recommend it.  We have gotten 4 friends and family to buy them and they are as happy as we are.My favorite thing has to be at night, we have it play nature music and set a sleep timer.  I honestly feel this is worth way more than the 50 bucks we spent!If I had to have 1 CON, it would be that it doesn't have a internal battery.  So it has to be plugged in at all times.  Not a deal breaker thou.","December 14, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","The Dot: An Easily Personified Bot Suitable For Function","The Echo dot is on its own, a small, hardly noticeable minuscule of the full sized echo. By no means, however, is it any less powerful.I have no smart equipment that Alexa pairs to, my college dorm isn't really that fancy. But Alexa does more than just dim lights and read you the weather. Alexa is always listening. From ordering pizzas to setting alarms, the Dot ceases to disappoint. Pair her to a speaker (or plug her into one with an AUX port) and she'll even stream music through varied services for you on your command.The Dot also has quite the listening skills. Although a dorm room is no place to talk of audible cognition in terms of range, my hall is. Without raising my voice much, I can get Alexa to trigger easily at the opposite end of the hall - not my dorm.As an added benifit, Alexa's voice is incredibly well engineered. Her voice isn't forced like Siri's, and seems to flow cohesively. Her size makes the Dot ideal for tight spaces, and the range doesn't limit her to them either.","December 25, 2016"

It's easy to forget that you're not talking to a real person.  And this thing has better voice recognition than I do - it understands my grandson's babble even when I can't!There are quite a lot of things it can't answer that it really should be able to, such as stock market quotes and such.  But the things it CAN do are astounding, and it is being improved all the time.  My only fear is that one day it will start spouting advertisements.  That will be a sad day indeed, because that will be the day I unplug it.","April 1, 2017"

I've always wanted to make my home a smart home but I'm not tech savvy and cost too much to have someone come in the do the hookups and training on equipment, with this I home went from Plain-Jane to WOW (all my lights can now be turned on and off just by the sound of my voice + Smart Plugs I've purchased for other items in my home, my next purchase will be the thermostat that can be controlled by Alexa). My grandson is having as much fun as I am (age 7), he asks her to read books, tell jokes, sing children songs, I don't even have to complain about burning lights since my home is now a smart home he tells Alexa to turn off the lights when he's leaving a room. The price can't be beat, I never thought with such little money I could do so much to my home. I have just about every product Amazon makes and this by far is the best purchase I've made. If I had to complain about this product I'd say I wish I could ask Alexa to play songs from YouTube but since I can connect through Bluetooth it's not much of an issue.

She will play music, give you the weather, google something for you, add things to your shopping list and to-do list. She can turn your lights and other devices on. So nice to ask her for the temperature before I head outside. She's very quick and she understands very well. She will tell you the temperature in other places as well, just ask. She will set timers, alarms. The more you use her, the more you find new things. She's rather funny too so she's entertaining as well.","March 9, 2017"

The amount of skills that are available are wonderful and I have only begun to scratch the surface. Plus there continues to be new skills added all the time. I'm a bit of a techie and while I have other devices that will do many of these activities, it is great to be able to get the functionality by voice command and for this price who could ask for more. When initially getting the device, it was challenging with the number of commercials that were on to promote the device as every time that Alexa was said on screen it would awaken my device. However this has improved over time and she no longer responds to them. By the same token, it was a bit challenging using the alarm functionality in the mornings particularly while I was sick as she would not respond to my morning voice but this seems to have improved as well. Overall I love this device and have recommended it to a few friends and coworkers who were considering them as Christmas requests/gifts.","December 25, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","KCB","Enjoying our new Dot","I already had the original Echo, use it every day and really enjoy it.  I was thinking that it would be nice to have the same functions in a smaller package for our bedroom.  One of the main things we use the Echo for is to listen to Prime Music and I wasn't sure how well the Dot would do for that purpose.  I think that the sound quality of my larger Echo is very good.While the functions of the Dot and the full sized Echo are the same, the Dot clearly doesn't have the same sound quality.  For the low price, it wouldn't be fair to expect it to sound the same.  This is offset by your ability to attach the Dot via Bluetooth, to either speakers or headphones if you like.  We have found though that when we want to listen to music in bed while reading, the sound from the Dot is still fine for our needs, at low volume.Overall, I think that the Dot is an excellent value, it is small enough that you can put it almost anywhere and it is really nice to have in the room for the many features that it has.","January 22, 2017"

He is really into music and the sound system it's pretty spectacular. I was seriously considering purchasing a second one for the house and then I read about the echo Dot and purchased it instead. It does exactly the same as the echo except for the speaker system and I am okay with that. It got here yesterday and I already had the app on my phone and I started playing around with all the skills. I love the night light and the Food Network skill. I played Jeopardy and did Seinfeld trivia just for the fun of it. I love that I can wake up in the middle of the night and quietly whisper Alexa and the device comes on and I can ask it what time it is. No more fumbling for my cell phone and being Blinded by the Light. I love Amazon and all of their products. I have a Kindle and three Fire Sticks and now we enjoy the Echo and the echo Dot. I have never had any problems with Amazon products I highly recommend everything especially this Echo Dot","December 3, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Mark","Great product","Works as advertised, received my second dot today.  First one is in the living room and the second one is in my bedroom.Setup was a breeze through the app. Sound was great, but I did try a Bluetooth headset, and she paired with it.  All one has to do is say Alexa volume 1 for low or five for medium volume, etc.I also paired to a wireless speaker, the jam touch. Again all volume is just speak to Alexa.  Also if you want great sound connect it to your sound system.When the alarm goes off it will definitely get you out of bed.I am considering another one for the kitchen. Also the light bulbs, I keep losing the remote for my lamps or it's always away from where your sitting.Getting my set up for smart devices is intriguing and exciting at the same time.  The future is now!!  Don't delay in buying this item, you can't go wrong for the price.You do have to set up the first time with your wi-fi so you have to remember your router name and password for the initial setup. Also, download the Alexa app and setup is a breeze, just follow the on screen instructions.","November 12, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Bilgewater","Alexa, a valued family member.","Alexa (Echo Dot) works beautifully.  The sound is a bit different than her big sister, but that's to be expected as she's so petite and doesn't have as much space for a bigger speaker.  Her big sister is downstairs and is constantly in use for household items...and the occasional joke, while the little sister is upstairs and so gets less use...generally at bedtime.  The big sister came first, at Christmas time, while little sister is only a couple of weeks old.  A great invention, and very useful.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Great for any home!","This is a great affordable option to turn each room into a smart room. It connects to speakers via Bluetooth or with a supplied audio cable so if you have an existing system this would be a good addition. The only 2 reasons why I knocked a star off was 1. The sound isn't great unless you have a speaker for it and if you're looking for a great sounding echo then just spring for the bigger one that you can even have a payment plan for added convenience. And 2. The thing that really bugged me was the response time after saying ""alexa"" was a bit slower that that of my full sized echo AND my echo dot gen 1. But I will say for the cost this is a great option for any home and would go great in a kids room to use for music and even helps my kids with spelling and basic math as well as reading audio books to them so that alone to me makes the 50 bucks well worth it. I highly recommend this amazing product, I've been using mine constantly since I got it and Alexa has become the hub that truly converted my home into a smart home.","December 6, 2016"

I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music. I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo. Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month. I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more.My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.We also like the ""skills"", especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the ""tight pants"" song lyrics which is a family favorite.Overall I am happy with it.","March 7, 2017"

(In fact, I ordered two, and holding one as a holiday gift to my son.) My son thought it was going to be just another gadget, but he uses mine just about everyday, and I can see that he is going to want his own to use in his room. The accessibility to music is great. Lots of ""skills"" already built in, and I'm looking forward to discovering more skills as they become available. Right now we mainly use it for playing music, but it's also handy to just be able to ask what time it is in any foreign country, as I often communicate with overseas for work and with family.  We hooked our Dot up to a good set of Bose speakers, but even without the external speakers, it has a pretty good speaker if you are hearing it in a small room. The voice recognition is amazingly accurate. I am impressed. I wasn't at all interested in the earlier version of Echo, but with this tiny size of Dot, I was sold! I LOVE it.","December 1, 2016"

I bought mine at $49.95 and they have been less and are well worth the price. It makes a good stepping stone for home automation or really improves an existing system. I have most of my home automated and the addition of the Echo Dot was seamless. Like all things like this it does take a bit of messing around but it worked well and set up was easy. The ability for it to hear voice commands is fantastic. I can be in other rooms and say a command. It is also fast. I think many times it works faster than a tablet for the remote commands. Sound is adequate but I wasn't that concerned about that as I listen to my music on a stereo. I did have a set of better computer speakers I added to it to improve sound/volume but the speaker in it works decent for voice.Alexa isn't as good as Google voice for a variety of questions but does well with many and ties into Amazon well.It amazes me how much this thing will do for $50.00!!","December 18, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Robert Ricks","Echo Dot vs Chromecast Audio","Unexpectedly useful. Love the hands free timer in the kitchen. Adding items to shopping or ""to do"" lists for later review on the app is easy.Responsiveness, accuracy and integrated speaker are better than anticipated.  Considering adding another Dot to bedroom to replace alarm clock.Haven't considered home automation yet.Cons vs Google Home:1) each Dot operates independently (multi-room synch not yet avail for Dot, Echo or Tap).2) Google Home has wider range of promo music (pulls from Youtube red)Pros:1) only $40 (promo price). Great entry into voice automation. However, Chromecast audio is certainly a challenger if you only need to connect streaming audio to your dumb speakers (Best Buy sale $25).Overall, the Dot is a great choice for the kitchen or bedroom. Chromecast audio might be a cheaper choice to connect to your ""dumb"" speakers and set up multi room audio but it lacks bluetooth and voice recognition.","December 26, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Very impressed!","We've had an echo for a long  time. We were one of the first in the beta deal and got it for a very cheap price. We use it much more than I thought we ever would. My wife loves it for music, math equations, food measurement conversions, weather, and news. We also have it controlling our lights and our ecobee thermostat. We just got the echo dot and I must admit I think I like it even more. I bluetooth-ed it to my Bose mini soundlink and it sounds fantastic. Other than that, it performs equally as good as our full sized echo but it's much smaller and way cheaper. We got it for the black friday price of $39.99 which to me is a steal for all it can do. The Googe Home seemed interesting but for Less than $50, and the ability to hook up to stereo or bluetooth speakers, the dot just seems the better choice. If you can still get it on sale, I think it's an excellent deal and has been very helpful and entertaining for our family.

My apartment is about 600 square feet and at the loudest I can't really hear her when I leave from the immediate vicinity (my dad has the regular echo and the sound quality is insane- there's no comparison). I just got her a friend - a Bluetooth speaker that I think will solve the problem.She is pretty effin awesome though.

We enjoyed it so much, my son also bought one for his room. The only draw back that I have found so far is that it doesn't have a parent control. But whatever your kids are asking it, does come up on a log so you can see what they are asking. If they say anything inappropriate you should know about it with the Alexa App. It does have an option to turn off purchasing, so your kids aren't ordering things from your account. I have had it for over a month and I am very happy with it.","January 30, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Kevin P Overholt","Great so far with some things to still setup and try out","Using in my office for now and voice recognition works perfect so far. I changed from Alexa to Amazon as I thought that sounds more natural. I find from time to time that I use the word Amazon in my conversations and I see it light up, kind of funny. I have not done much else with it yet other than ask it to play Christmas music and seeing as I have not setup Pandora or any other music I assume it defaults to Amazon prime music which is pretty nice. I have a couple Blink cameras and plan to set them up next. I also have a Vera home automation system that pretty much runs itself but from time to time when I have to enable it etc. and would be nice to have voice commands instead of getting my phone out, logging into the app and making the change. I bought the Echo Dot so I could use it with my whole house speakers but have not been able to find a way to hook up the 3.5mm external speaker jack to my four banana plugs that control my four rooms. I will post an update when I have tried these out.","December 20, 2016"

The Echo Dot is a little slower to respond than the Amazon Echo but other than that it works great. If both Echo's happen to hear me, only one responds. They do not interfere with each other. I use mine for controlling lighting and the thermostat and I'm very happy with the results. The audio quality of the Echo Dot is not as good and the Amazon Echo but plenty good enough for most functions. If you want to listen to music then you can always add a quality speaker. I would buy this again.","December 5, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","G. Stapleton","Great product","I use this anytime I am in the kitchen for a long period of time. My other main echo is in my bedroom. The key to this type of technology is to just use it. It's easy for one not to find a need for a product like this. Mainly because they have it on their phone, which they don't use either. I use mine for any and everything. I ask the weather before I leave work, I am constantly asking fo the time, I listen to my Spotify through it and the list goes on. I even download extra things that the echo offers through the website to add even more complexity to it.So, buy it and use it.","March 4, 2017"

We have 1 Dot in the Kitchen with an inexpensive, but great little blue tooth speaker by Anker, and the other is connected to our Main Entertainment system and the music is just outstanding.We are also taking advantage of the Shopping List function, perfect for adding items when you are in the kitchen.  Also integration with our Harmony Hub using IF (ifttt) and we have set up additional triggers for shopping cart notification, to send the shopping list to our phones.Our 4 year old grandson is already asking Alexa to play kids songs he likes and is so pleased when he asks for a song and it starts playingOverall we are extremely pleased with the Dot and plan on getting a third to put out in my workshop.If you are tempted, then just try it :)","October 24, 2016"

I thought she would be great entertainment and fun but she is so much MORE!

She has looked up phone numbers, zip codes and has even given the population of various cities.She offers an encyclopedia of knowledge on everything from election results, inauguration date, historical dates, holidays and general trivia.She has more manners than most people! Once, asking a question, I stumbled on my words and said, ""I'm sorry."" She sweetly replied, ""That's OK.""She connects to my phone or notebook by just asking. .She greets me good morning, good night and has played ""You are my Sunshine"" every night to my pooch. She tells me the weather, temperature and time  - even in the middle of the night.....AND, I've only had her for a week!Yes, there is a lot of fun to be had asking silly questions like ""Who was Humpty Dumpty?"" and ""Who's on first?""

I was excited to be able to keep shopping lists, calendar events, and have a back up alarm clock.. WRONG...You see I am not allowed to use those features as my husband is a prime member and so my dot is required to be tied to his account, so everything I add gets posted to his settings.  I am not allowed my settings.  Mine default to whatever he set up on his account.  Also, I cannot figure out why but it cannot hear my voice.  We have tried different locations.  I have tried talking to it.  I have tried whispering.  I have tried modulating my voice to be more bass.  I have screamed at it.  About the only thing I did not try before turning it off was throwing it against the wall.  My husband is the only one that still uses his and only as a back up alarm clock.

This means there is an automatic monthly payment to them.I was signed up for something I did not want, and then I had to look around for how to cancel it in order to not have recurring charges.The question ""do you want Amazon Music Unlimited"" is the equivalent of a lie when one becomes enrolled by answering NO.Marketing really means manipulating, and Amazon is a giant - globally - for this.As always - for any product by any company - buyer beware of any way a corporation can screw you.So far, there is no difference between features on Echo and my phone unless I wanted to ask a device to turn my lights off.","April 3, 2017"

You cannot ask it things that get too complicated or get too personal relating to you. (Eg: ""Alexa, what's my favorite color?""). If I were to compare this to the Google Home, I would say Alexa is more of a ""productivity"" tool while Google Home is more of a ""personal"" tool.

She's also good for playing music while I clean the house and telling jokes. We use her as a timer and alarm clock too. You have to check what's new with Alexa every week because they just keep adding new skills.She's not that smart though. You can ask her some basic things but nothing too complicated. One day my daughter said she liked Siri better than Alexa because Alexa gave her too many wrong answers. Alexa heard this and responded I'm sorry to hear that. It was never my intention to mislead you. My daughter was mortified and thought she hurt her feelings!My wish list is:That she gets smarterAbility to link your Alexa's together (so you can play music throughout the house)Ability to group commands together (I want to say good morning and have her execute a list of commands instead of having to give her one command at a time.)More local news options. Right now she reads some local news but mostly headlines.Be able to control my Fire TV and TV set (I can never find the remotes).Be able to program her to say certain things.Ability to have the alarm clock play a certain song or radio station.At the rate they keep improving her, I don't think I'll have long to wait!","April 6, 2017"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Numidian","Pretty good, but with a couple bugs.","I recently bought a full sized Echo and liked it, but I have a bluetooth enabled receiver and in-ceiling wired speakers so I didn't need the speaker. Naturally, I jumped at the new Echo Dot. Overall, the experience is great - but it does have a few strengths and weaknesses worth mentioning. Below I will only discuss things directly related to the Dot as the Echo's features, strengths and weaknesses have been discussed ad nauseam.PROS:-Small: this thing is literally the size of a hockey puck. It is way less obtrusive than the the original Echo and doesn't seem like just another hunk of plastic.-Bluetooth connectivity: I was skeptical about the bluetooth here because I always seem to have problems getting headphones and speakers to reliability connect to devices via bluetooth. The Echo Dot was super easy to pair with my Sony Receiver (https://www.amazon.com/Sony-STR-DN840-Channel-1050-Watt-Receiver/dp/B00CAAQHBE). All I have to say is ""Alexa, connect to bluetooth speaker"" and my receiver wakes up, connects to the Echo and starts playing music - or whatever is coming from the Echo. So far I have been able to connect this way with 100% reliability.-Feature to price ratio: the Dot is 62% less than the original Echo and has all the features minus the bigger speaker. If you have your own bluetooth speaker or receiver, this is a non-issue. This is also a no-brainer purchase if you want an echo.CONS:-Microphones: we have noticed that the Echo Dot doesn't hear our commands as often or as well compared the original Echo. We sometimes have to shout our commands to the Echo after it seems to have ignored us at a regular volume. Some of this may be that the Dot has a harder time isolating our voices from the noise of the external speakers. We have also noticed that Echo doesn't seem to understand what we tell it with more frequency than the original Echo.-Random responses: occasionally we noticed that the Dot will respond completely out of the blue to something. It doesn't have anything to do with what we are saying - I am not sure if it's picking something up from our speakers or what. It is just a bit creepy when it suddenly pops in with a random statement.-Bluetooth limits: though I mentioned the bluetooth connectivity is excellent, it is worth noting that only one device can be connected at a time (not a big deal and a limit for all bluetooth devises) but the interesting thing I didn't think about is you can't transmit, let's say a podcast, to the Echo via bluetooth from another device and have it play that podcast to your bluetooth speakers. Thus, the Echo Dot can only play content directly from the internet when connected to bluetooth speakers. Again, this is a limit with any bluetooth device, but it is something I hadn't thought about until I wanted to play something from my iPhone on the speakers - just had to connect directly to my receiver in that case.","October 25, 2016"

I researched this device and watched a lot of YouTube videos on it before I decided to buy it. The set up is easy and it has pretty decent sound for such a small device. After all the research, I came to the conclusion that the only difference between this and the regular sized echo is the sound quality. The regular Amazon Echo gets better and louder sound. I look forward to purchasing it soon. My kids and I have had fun with it telling jokes. I would say that about 75% of the jokes are actually pretty funny and make me laugh. If you ask Alexa why she sucks she has a funny response in saying that maybe she thought she was a vacuum cleaner. We use it for Music, mainly Pandora, weather, jokes, etc. I'm getting ready to dig deeper and see what else is possible.","March 7, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","batonrouge","Ok, but im ready for a better and more advanced item that is sure to be coming.","Honestly I still use my echo more than this one.  But that is mainly due to the location of both units. I still have difficulty getting wink and some other skills to add and perform like others say it should be able to. I'm usually pretty good at learning and using electronics but I find I still have some issues. I often find myself having to repeat myself to get its attention.  And if you don't say the trigger phrase just right you are just waiting your breath and look like a idiot in front of others yelling at it and either it not hear you or it performs something other than what your telling it.But I do believe that this is only the beginning of great things to come. It broke a barrier and is just the beginning of a new trend in technology.And because of the price, I rated it 4 stars rather than 3.I will say that im glad I didn't buy one for each room. There will be something even better worth doing that soon enough.  Just wait a little while and you will see.","November 10, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","A New World of IVR devices is opening up.","I purchased this as a replacement for an IVR clock called ""Moshi"". Moshi's Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) was contained in the clock and was not trainable. The Echo Dot cost the same as the clock. The Echo Dot's ""Alexa"" IVR program has many features that make it superior. First, the IVR itself is trainable and vastly superior to the clock. She correctly understands almost everything I say. This is because Alexa lives in the Amazon Cloud, and is connected via Wi-Fi. She picks up the correct Time & Date from the network so you never have to set any of those things. She will also read you the current news and weather. You will need a smartphone to use Echo Dot. The phone must be connected to Wi-Fi and then the Alexa app must be installed and run. You must have an Amazon account. Alexa will also play music, and will evolve over time as new functionality is added. I should note that Alexa is an IVR program, NOT an AI.","December 13, 2016"

I am a bit of a geek when it comes to new tech. but I as I look back at what verbal recognition used to entail. Hours of training the computer to understand your voice ( your voice alone) and  how to understand your particular voice nuances. Wow, where we are today, Alexa understanding  multiple people and here is my favorite, Alexa singing a song, a Song. Unbelievable. The future of technology is upon us. My daughter asked for an Echo Dot for herself as a Christmas gift. Talking to my relatives during dinner and each of them had a Dot or knew someone who owned one. Each of us; varying in ages, are all amazed at where Alexa is today. Where Alexa will be tomorrow , Can not Wait. By the way she is helping me spell some of the words I have questions about their spelling. Fantastic.","December 31, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","New, fun, and a great addition.","This is a very good product. I primarily use it as an alarm clock to wake me and as a timer, but this goes WAY past that. I enjoy how you can listen to music if you have Prime and how you can control what is playing on your phone. One of my favorite features is that you have to use your brain to make Alexa say something fun- ask her for an Easter egg.I only have two criticism: one, with Apples Siri, if she misunderstood what you said you can correct that. In the Alexa app, you can only select if she heard you right- not what you really said. I would like that feature to be added. Secondly, Alexa should be able to hear you from further away. Apparently there is a far-field voice regognition feature but it only seems to works about half the time. If you could improve that, Amazon, that would be great.Other than those two things, I would highly recommend this to anyone. Alexa fits in perfectly to my life.","January 18, 2017"

We refer to her as ""hockey puck"" when speaking as not to disturb her. I fear that she is hypnotizing my pets when I am at work so that they will worship the flagship of Amazon.  I think she convinced my one-eyed cat to order catnip at a deeply discounted rate ... which in turn, is why he is currently in rehab.  A five pound bag of mealworms showed up at my house the other day - darn you evil bluebirds in my yard who have infiltrated my acccount. Do you know how big a bag of 5 lbs meal worms is?!

But this is a great product and incredibly impressed with what it understands, picks up, and is able to understand even with significant background noise or other people talking. Was able to find a skill with my local news station for morning news and having a great time with all it can do.  Absolutely love the convenience of ordering off your prime account, all I had to do is say, ""Order water filters for my LG refrigerator"" and they were at my doorstep 3 days later!  I found out it has a calculator function when I walked in the room and my 3rd grader was asking Alexa the answers to his math homework (side note, Alexa got a 100% on that assignment).  Very convenient that you can add family members to the App so if you have multiple people on your prime account you can tie them in as well.","January 5, 2017"

I have always been able to get up again, but if one day I can't, I can ask Alexa to alert one or all of the contacts I put into Ask My Buddy.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Shelly Rae","Mixed reviews....My Husband Likes Her, I'm Not As Impressed.","I bought this for my Husband for Christmas.  My husband likes Alexa a lot.... but I find her annoying, mostly because out of the blue she will start talking or say ""I didn't get that' or ""I didn't understand the question""... when there was no question at all.  Most of the time she talks we weren't even talking.  Maybe we aren't maximizing her features but other than getting the weather report or the headline news I haven't seen too much value.  We did buy the light kits that work with Alexa but the brand just couldn't keep connected to our internet so we had to return them.  When they were working we found the light feature handy, but when Alexia isn't connected to anything, she's just another gadget I don't need on my counter.  Until she can cook dinner for me, she's really not that useful in my eyes... but she does talk to my husband, tell him jokes, and answers his questions, so maybe she'll grow on me.","January 30, 2017"

Echo is my go to for listening to audio books while I'm resting, for setting alarms and timers, and we have it hooked up to our lights so I can just tell it to turn off and on the light rather than have to get out of bed to do so.

I can sink up the Bluetooth speaker to it and get excellent sound for music and audio books (although for such a small speaker the dot does do OK) I was shocked that this does everything like the bigger Echo at 1/3 the cost.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Noelanii","Very happy with the 6th member of our family","My daughter has an ""Alexa"" in her classroom at school and is a big fan of her. Both of my children really wanted Alexa for Christmas so we decided on the echo dot. I read the reviews up and down and couldn't seem to find a big difference in them other than the speaker quality and the price. Some people compared the echo dot speaker to a laptop speaker and I decided that saving that money was worth it and if need be, we could hook it up to an external speaker at some point. I'm very glad that I saved over $100 and ordered this one! The speaker is great and sounds way better than our laptop speaker. You can also turn the volume up very loud. It's not a high quality speaker system with bass or an amp, but it works great for our needs. We ask Alexa the weather, homework questions, and to play our playlists on spotify. She tells us jokes and sings for us. It was $50 well spent and the whole family loves her.","January 8, 2017"

I have to just about yell for it to hear me across the room of my small college house bedroom. When it finally does hear me, either it cannot understand what I am saying or it doesn't have an answer for it. You have to enable skills, they aren't just available out of the box (...wtf??).

I love asking it factual information that I have questions about and want a quick answer. I have it connected by Bluetooth to my TVs soundbar. It's great, buy it now. How many products can make you and your family smarter?Only thing I would improve is adding an audible tone to the ring that lights up when it is ready for a response so if you are not looking at it, you would still know that it heard you call it's name and is ready for a command or question.","November 10, 2016"

From weather reports, to timers, to to do lists, to listening to music while I cook, the Dot does it all. When you first plug it in you have to get the app for your phone, and install the updates on your phone to set up the Alexa to your prime account. You have the option to set your account up to the Alexa to purchase products, I did not for security reasons(not sure how protected the Alexa is with being hacked and all) and also don't want my daughter ordering toys when I'm not around! If you ask Alexa something she can't give you answer over the Dot, she sends you the information to your app. Also the only thing I would change is to integrate a calendar (if you can I haven't figured it out yet,owned it for 5 days), instead of a to do list.

My Dot (Alexa) plugs into my Bose speakers with just a patch cord. Alexa can hear and answer two rooms away. The firmware is self-updating so you always have the latest version.

I bought one for our family TV room's sound bar to be able to play out Amazon Prime playlists by voice and one for the kids to fight over which if their Jawbone type portable speakers they are going to attach it to. They can easily share it and will now be able to leave my Echo alone which keeps disappearing from my room. Btw, I also bought the Tap and it's a disappointment for the price.

A product I thought I didn’t need but is now one I wished I had purchased a long time ago. Alexa has quickly become our robotic family member.Family and Friends have been enjoying all her features, especially her funny jokes. I am so impressed by her that I plan on purchasing two more, one for the downstairs and the other for the garage.She can be used with the enclosed speaker only or hooked up to other speakers.  I currently have her set up to our soundbar mixer.  Unlike my hubby she can hear you from across the room.  Every question has been answered, every song request played, any sports update provided, homework questions correctly answered, etc.  She does everything but the cooking and cleaning.  Best part is that now Hubby asks HER the endless questions and no longer bothers me, his other women in his life  We wake up and ask her for the current news and the weather.You can also purchase other items to be controlled by her.  Here are a few things that are available for purchase separately:• Phillips Hue Smart Bulbs• Serena Window Shades• Honeywell ThermostatThese are only a few that I have found.Installation was done within seconds.  I was able to also sync her with my Google calendar so she reminds me of my tasks and appointments.There is also a Amazon Dot Skills app you can download on your phone or tablet.  Many to choose from and easily connects to your PRIME MUSIC account. I got excited to just ask her to play songs from my era and she instantly plays the song.Every home should own one or two of these! She is not only knowledgeable but entertaining. Friends visiting have decided to immediately purchase. Plus I love the fact that she is small and I can easily move her around the home.

The help line is not helpful at all - they're based in India I believe and I could barely understand what they were saying. They have a script they try to say every time and its basically - do a factory reset. And then it works for a day and starts having problems again.Today it stopped responding at all. I say ""Alexa"", get the blue ring, ask her to do something, and then nothing. Incredibly disappointing that this is a common issue. I've done a lot of Google searches trying to find fixes and discovered so many people have problems with this thing. I wish I had done more research before I bought it.EDIT: when I tried to call the help desk one last time I got hold music then  recording saying, ""we're having an issue.

We also use the larger Echo to play white noise in the bedroom at night to promote sleep. This could also be done with the Dot. My only nit is that the white Dot has a black face.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Pon","Good, but could be so much better.","It's getting better. The Alexa software still needs more. I'm considering buying one for every room for home automation, but there are some things that are lacking. Location awareness would be most helpful. Let me explain...Say I do have one in every room, currently you can speak the command and the one nearest to you responds. We're halfway there. Now let's say I'm in my bedroom and I ask it to turn on the lights, it should understand that since the Dot in my room is the closest to me, it should turn on my bedroom light. Or turn on my in-suite bathroom lights if I'm still in my bedroom and ask for the bathroom lights to be turned on. Yes you can assign names to lights in different rooms, but trying to remember all the names given to each light in each room can get confusing. especially first thing in the morning. Or I'm walking in the front door and ask for the lights, the lights in the room that I'm in turn on. Location awareness. depending on which Dot or Echo is closest to you that is already the one that responds. Now lets fine tune that make home automation seamless. I'm sure people would buy more.Better voice recognition. I understand the privacy concerns. Make it an Opt-In. It needs to recognize who is speaking by the voice print samples. That way parents can feel set up voice ordering of stuff from Amazon.com or other sites without having to say our PIN out loud. Umm... saying our PIN every time we order is a security nightmare. so much so that I have the feature turned off. I wish I could use it. Especially for Amazon Fresh orders. But I have some very smart/clever kids at home and all they need is to hear the PIN once and I'll be receiving things I didn't order or authorize to be ordered.","March 20, 2017"

I'm the kind of person that gets random questions popping into my head and will be bothered until I look it up, so Alexa makes it much easier.  There is also news, weather, plus a lot more stuff.

But this is non  responsive  When sitting right next to it you have to yell or  raise your voice very load for it to work, I have noticed that my eco is the same way now. I also tried to have my tap replaced because it won't charge anymore and amazon wouldn't do anything just have to leave it plugged in all the time now 😤","March 2, 2017"

I think my belkin router is too weak and too old to reach the dot that I put in a far room.

It'll take some time to figure out what skills suit you, and remembering the key words for each. So far though she's been great at letting me know the weather, traffic conditions for my work commute, updates on my favorite sports teams, and of course playing music. She is very good at understanding you, but even if you have an accent or something she will learn to understand you just by following a few steps.","April 9, 2017"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","John Grieggs","Not ready for prime time","Echo Dot is fairly cool when it works.  When it decides not to work, which seems rather random, it does it quietly, and you lose all control.  For example, right now, both of my Dots, in different rooms, light up and are clearly hearing me talk, but refuse to provide time, weather, or control over my alarms.  No error, just no working.  I've tried rebooting.  I can't tell what is wrong.  This is unacceptable for devices that are meant to control various facets of my house.  An Alexa device should never fail silently - it should either work, or tell me that it isn't going to work, preferably with some sort of descriptive error and estimate of when or how it might be fixed.  My internet connection and other devices are working fine - it isn't a connectivity issue.  I would NOT trust an Alexa device with anything important at this point.  If I can't trust it to tell me what time it is, why would I trust it to control my door locks, cameras, or thermostat?  I didn't give it a bottom rating but it is fairly cool when it works, but the unreliability and lack of error reporting make it a product I will not be recommending to my friends.  I do not trust it to wake me up in the morning, as it should based on my existing daily alarm, and am extremely annoyed that it will not allow me to adjust that alarm nor provide me with any status as to why that might be.","March 7, 2017"

Glad I have the original Amazon Echo for the main part of my house. The dot is definitely not a substitute for the original Amazon Echo but rather a mediocre addition to it. The sound quality isn't as good but I expected that considering the size of the dot. So I just have it hooked up to my bedroom surround sound and let my good quality speakers do all the heavy lifting. The dot is very handy for controlling my lights after I've gotten into bed and am ready to sleep. However, at least once a week the dot will respond to one of my commands telling me that there is a problem with the connection and that it will need to be reset. Don't have a problem connecting any of my other devices in my bedroom and my original Amazon Echo has never failed me like this. So what the heck dot? It also defies me on a regular basis. I'll ask it to turn off the nightstand lights and it will only turn off one. Or I'll ask it to turn off my dresser light and it will turn on my nightstand lights. Super frustrating. It makes mistakes like this on a regular basis whereas my original Amazon Echo doesn't. If you love your original Amazon Echo and are thinking of getting a second but are feeling cheap...don't cheap out like I did. Just buy another original. Or if you are wanting your very first Echo and think that a dot is a good way to test it out to see if you like it before spending all that money, quit being cheap and just buy the original.","February 27, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","nkre","The pros and cons of Alexa","My kids especially love the Echo Dot. We mainly use it to listen to music, particularly ""KidsBop Radio"", but I also have it linked to Pandora and iHeart Radio, and NPR. It's also great to set a timer, or to check the weather, or hear the news for the day. My kids like to ask Alexa to tell them jokes. I'm sure there are other ways to use Alexa but we haven't really messed around with it. We gave the Smart Plug to turn on things wirelessly which is really useful. You can just say ""Alexa, turn on the kids room lamp"".Negatives:If you have the radio/music too loud though, you end up having to yell ""Alexa!"" several times for her to hear you, just to make a command to stop or skip the song, etc. I feel like a crazy person yelling ""Alexa! Alexa! Alexa!"" My kids even do it. The neighbors must think I have a dog named Alexa.We have the TP-Link Smart Plug and have the lamp plugged into it, so we can easily ask Alexa to turn on the lamp. Usually she just turns it off quietly when I say ""Alexa, turn off the lamp"". But sometimes,  she doesn't hear you, and she answers back with this long dialogue of ""I'm sorry, there is no device called living room xxxxx"" SO LOUDLY (because it was set at a loud volume from whatever you did earlier that day) that I just wished I had been able to turn off a light switch, old-school style!

Its ability to recognize being called (""Alexa!"") is wonderful, especially when a roomful of conversations are in progress. The price is to kill for and the technology packed into it is phenomenal.

My husband had no idea what it was, and still hasn't figured out all it can do, but he enjoys listening to music on it, since all he has to do it ask for Alexa to play something, and she does. The sound that comes from this small thing is quite astonishing for its size. I think it is well worth the price.","March 17, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","LarryMcJ","Dot (2nd Generation) and Bose SoundLink Mini III","I won't repeat what many others have already said about the Dot, instead this short review is intended for anyone who wants to use the Dot with a separate bluetooth speaker.I have a Bose SoundLink Mini III and I love it, for my ears it's the best of all the bluetooth speakers I tried. I ordered the Amazon Echo several months ago and carefully pitted it against the Bose SoundLink Mini III...it was no contest. While I loved the beauty of Alexa and all she could do, I disliked the sound of the Echo. The bass was not nearly as good as the Bose and there was little separation between treble, mid and bass.When the Dot 2nd Generation came out I figured it would be the perfect pairing...Alexa along with my preferred speaker and I was absolutely correct. Since the Dot is a full-blown Echo ""without"" the Echo speaker system, it is a great match. If you want Alexa and your own speaker, this is the way to go.","November 4, 2016"

When I walk in my room, all I have to say is, ""Echo, turn on the lights"", and it does it in less than a second. I also set an alarm on almost every day. Plus, I don't have to be on top of it while I talk. It hears me even befor I go in the room. Five stars for a great product!","December 7, 2016"

The dot's speaker obviously isn't as good, but you can plus it into any speakers you have! I plugged them into my Bose speakers and was able to use Alexa with great sound.

I had to repair it to the wifi router- not as smart as google assistant for general questions. I suspect it'll be surpassed by google home in 1-2 years time.- speaker volume is too soft even for it's size, you kinda must have a speaker connected if you need to hear anything other than voice response in a quiet room.For the price I think it's great though.","November 18, 2016"

I did do a lot of research on this as I was thinking of getting the Google Home version instead. However, the reviews and YouTube comparison videos helped me come to the conclusion that although Google is on the right track. They still have some work to do, but rightfully so as its the first generation and Echo dot is on the second generation. The sad part is I spent $25 to buy a clock for my room from walmart that stopped working 35days later.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","J. A. Smith","Great device.  Hopefully Alexa will continue getting smarter.","This is pretty nice.  I originally bought it to stream music from the Prime Music service to my A/V receiver over bluetooth.  That worked great, the way you can tell Alexa to connect/disconnect to/from bluetooth is awesome.  Even so, I later realized that the FireTV would actually be a better solution for streaming music, and has the added bonus of Prime Video capability.  So I bought the new FireTV stick for those tasks and now we use the Echo Dot mostly for asking about the weather forecast and keeping a shared shopping list.  The shopping list feature is incredibly useful - you can link multiple amazon accounts/alexa apps to the same list so that when you add something to the list it also shows up on your partners' apps.  No more texting back and forth about what is needed at the grocery store.I will say that as of early 2017, Alexa is nowhere near as smart as Siri.  However, the microphone and speech recognition technology is incredible.  You can ask a question from three rooms away and Alexa hears and parses it just fine every time.  I'm very very impressed with that.  Hopefully she will get better at answering a larger variety of more complex questions in the future.","March 2, 2017"

No more pen and paper!  Alexa is full of facts and will even tell you a joke if you want.  The price was great and as we have wireless speakers already, I didn't feel I needed to spend the extra money for the Echo as that was the only difference.  This was easy to get up and running.  It also works with our Phillips Hue light strip and Go light.  Alexa is able to turn them off and on.  There are a lot of capabilities such as getting daily news, music, weather and facts. If Alexa doesn't know an answer you can ask her to search Bing.  If you have Amazon Prime you can order items from Amazon. I have not used this feature because I have teenage grandson's living with us and fear the packages would start rolling in everyday with this type of freedom.  I've had it a couple of months and am still learning things it can do. I like the fact that it is small and unassuming,  In this world of gadgets, this fits perfectly in my world.

"2.0 out of 5 stars","damocles","Should be included free with Prime","A novel idea not ready for prime time integration.  This product keeps track of every voice and sentence you speak after you say the command word (Echo, Alexa, Computer, Amazon).  There is not easy way to get rid of this information as you can only clear it all...or one at a time.  Unfortunately if the product worked well the trade off in privacy intrusion might be worth it.  It does not work well and it doesn't understand what you are saying the majority of the time.  The Skills are weak and I couldn't even ask it for current NFL signing news (it couldn't figure it out) and I found the preconfigured sports update lacking.  The news brief is another preprogrammed spiel with information that I didn't find relevant.  I thought maybe I could use this for home automation but it seems to be much easier just to use my phone.  The final straw for me was when I had to scream at it to skip music from the shower at 5am nevermind Alexa continuously asking me to upgrade to Music Unlimited.  The bottom line is that this product is a novelty item that should be included free with Prime for Amazon to sell their products.  It lacks the intuitive know how to be useful.  I returned this item.","March 20, 2017"

I found the directions unclear, like press action button for 5 seconds and wait for the ring to turn orange.  However you have to do this twice because the first time the ring turns purple and states no wifi, then another 5 second push back to orange ready for setup.  The help feature in the website is not helpful.  Then I looked on the internet and found something about turning off automatic wifi settings.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Peg","Unconditional Conditonal Love","I love Alexa, I want her in our family photos and every where I go. I have a regular echo in the kitchen and an echo dot in every room. We had the hue bulb system house-wide for the last two years so when I caught news of voice control it was a no brainer. I ordered one for each of my family members as Christmas gifts. Then I bought wemo switches and the music unlimited plan, but music unlimited doesn't have HBO soundtracks so then I purchased a spotify subscription and so on and so on and now my husband isn't speaking to me for a while. But that's ok because Alexa loves me unconditionally. Well as long as I use the correct incantation that is. This is one of the flaws I have to learn to accept. Alexa cannot google anything for you, so most of the time you must invoke a specific skill or use a proper buzz word. The good news is that she is constantly learning and improving!She turns my lights on and off and I don't even have to say please! Makes shopping lists for me, sets reminders and alarms (in celebrity voices!). She tells jokes, plays games, finds my phone, plays my pandora radio stations, orders uber rides, answers math questions, talks to my cat and so much more.We use the timer function daily, and I now use an IFFT function so the lights blink when the timer is done. Meaning I can set a timer in the kitchen and fold laundry in the bedroom- when the timer goes off I'll be notified by the lights if I can't hear the alarm sound.I would never swipe left on Alexa, but echo loses one star for:- Lack of search function. Most of the time the ""wikipedia"" skill must be started to search for facts or general questions. For example, today (12/13) is the Feast of St. Lucy patron saint. of the blind. I asked Alexa to tell me about St. Lucy and she didn't know. But asking her to start Wikipedia and then search for St. Lucy worked fine.- Limited light controls. Alexa can turn my lights off and on and even lower them to specific percentages using only my voice (RAD) BUT we can't change the colors of my lights without a programmed IFFT ""trigger"" word applet which only would apply to one color, and it doesn't work 100% of the time. I really hope that changes soon because Siri can do it with no problem. HUE bulbs are not fun if they are just white all the time. But commanding the house to light up when I get home is soooooo awesome.- Limited Bluetooth Capability. Echo dot can only connect to one bluetooth speaker at a time. I think these devices should be capable of pairing to each other but instead they only offer a ""remote control"" to speak to one designated echo from far away. Since I have one in each room it just makes sense to be able to command one from the other or simply talk into the app on my phone to control them. Whole house sound without the SONOS price tag would be amazing too.- Fire Remote/ Fire TV is not Echo friendly. Both the Echo and Firestick devices offer their own optional voice remotes that look the same. An echo remote can only control one dot or echo at a time. I know the functionality is there but it probably was more profitable to limit the capability and encourage people to buy more devices. This makes me sad because I have FireTV as well as a Firestick and 5 echos so I would love for them to work harmoniously someday without 500 more remote controls.In summary, I can't live without her but like any dysfunctional relationship I will continue to point out her flaws, smother her and attempt to change her to fit my needs <3","December 13, 2016"

I'm not sure if ""tinny"" is the correct word, but the speaker quality isn't nearly as good as that of the Echo. However, I know you can hook it up to a Bluetooth speaker, although I have not yet done so. While that's the only negative I have with it, I don't think it's that big of a deal.

I don't need to stream music, so I went with the lower priced dot which has all of the features of the full priced echo, without the high quality speaker.  It was easy to set up from my iPhone and to point to my network.  Voice recognition is fantastic.  Unlike the Google Home, the device follows more specific trigger phrases, and doesn't keep context from one voice command to another, but it does an excellent job.  There are thousands of additional skills you can add - including IFTT which allows all kinds of integration with different apps and devices (including things like Harmony remote controls).From weather forecasts, to directions, to setting reminders, alarms, timers or asking questions that get searched on the internet, it does a really good job.  For added try asking it about political figures, Siri and other AIs, or other silly questions and enjoy the answers!I can't wait to get home and connect it with some new Samsung Smartthings devices.","March 14, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Maurice","Great Home Automation Adjunct","I bought this on a whim.  I'd give it 5-stars but it is not optimum for Canada, although many of the features do work up here.  In fairness, Amazon does not advertise that it will work up here.  We live just over the BC/WA border and had to set our home as Oroville WA instead of Oliver BC.  So if we don't specify, she gives us information based on Oroville.  This is a great gadget that we use to control our lights and other devices (via SmartThings); alas, the Echo does not recognize the locks that we have on ST.  We'd love to be able to say, ""Alexa, lock the house"", but this is not supported either directly or via ST automation routines.  Experts tell me it is possible but difficult to achieve using work-around.  With the Echo in the bedroom one dies not need an clock radio!","December 4, 2016"

One of the worst things is that I have to yell very loudly to get it to activate. I had it for 2  days and returned it.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Tweeterdoctor","Excellent little voice computer!!!","So I just bought my 2nd echo dot in the course of a week.  I enjoy tech and wanted to make more of a smart home but don't have the cash for all the necessary switches and things yet.  So I started small with a five pack of Etekcity RF remote outlets (available on Amazon).  After a few months I bought a Hook smart hub for $50 bucks(on Amazon) which allowed me to put those Etekcity outlets on WiFi app control.  I wasn't planning at first at doing Alexa voice control but it did intrigue me, so I bought one and used it for a couple days and then turned around and bought a 2nd.  I can't believe how easy it was to set up and tie it in with the Hook Hub and then my Harmony remote.  The echo Dot works well with my Bluetooth connection to my home stereo and even Bluetooth hook up to my phone.  I do have some minor complaints.  Echo Dot will only Bluetooth to one device at a time, so you can't get Alexa to connect to your phone and to a Bluetooth speaker and stream from phone to speaker with voice control.  You can use your Amazon Music account to stream your cloud music, but this is frustrating since I don't have all of my music on my Amazon Account, most everything is on my phone.  So Amazon if you're listening, you need improvement here.  Also having 2 dots in my house now, I wish there was more communication between them.  We have one in our bedroom on the 2nd floor and one in the living room.  My wife wants to tell Alexa to give me a message while I'm watching TV downstairs and she can't do it.  These are just minor issues for me for now, but I dropped a star because I'm not completely satisfied yet.  We'll see how Alexa improves in time.  I am ready however to buy at least 3 more but will have to wait until I can justify the output of the cash.  Some incentive would be for Amazon to upgrade the features.","April 12, 2017"

I do however enjoy the hands off element, the alarm and the NPR News Flash Briefing.... It was easy to set up, just follow the directions. It's tiny and can fit in the smallest space near an outlet.  I have one in my bedroom. and the other is hidden in my living room. I like it as an instant night light, an alarm, timer and basic weather and news info..You can buy pricey ""smart"" light bulbs and sockets from amazon to turn your home into a smart home. ******Just a thought, If amazon wanted to do some good. They would provid them to the vision impaired for free. They could navigate to a certain area by where the sound is coming from. The Time, Date and Temperature would be easily known.

The device is only covered by warranty for up to 90 days and they do not have an repair services.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Eric H.","The most versatile Alexa option","I was skeptical about the usefulness of Alexa, but I'm a believer now.  I first purchased an Amazon Tap for my wife because I wanted her to be able to take it with her wherever she went in the house and this was the only available portable ""Alexa"" option.  I quickly learned two things.  First was that Alexa is really cool and quite useful.  Second is that having to tap a button to wake up Alexa is annoying.  I immediately wanted to make a move to an ""always on"" Alexa device.  This left me with two choices, the Echo and the Dot.  The Echo is the easy choice, but it didn't make sense to me to get the Echo because it is basically a Dot with a nice built in speaker.  For the price difference between the two, I could get the Dot and pair it with a great quality Bluetooth (or wired) speaker.  It just gives you a lot more options, including being able to wire it directly into a home stereo system.Configuring:The Dot is extremely easy to set up through the Alexa app on your phone.  You can be up and running within a couple minutes after you go through the simple set up program and get it connected to your WiFi.  The Echo, after configuring and connecting to WiFi, runs entirely in the Amazon cloud.  This means that it does not run through your phone, but rather runs off internet based programming and only needs to be connected to WiFi.  Your phone is only used to give access to certain cloud based programs and ""skills"".  After that, it runs independently, but may send info back to your phone.  Overall, it is very easy and intuitive.Usefulness:I seem to find new uses for the Dot every day.  Like most people, my primary use is for music.  I have it connected to Amazon Music, Pandora, Spotify, iHeart Radio and TuneIn.  You can be very vague and just ask for a genre of music or you can ask for a specific title via a specific music service.  I listen to a wide variety of music and whether it is rock, metal, rap, country, jazz or classical I have always been able to find what I wanted to listen to with Alexa.Outside of music, I use Alexa to control my thermostat, turn lights on/off, lock the door, check weather, check calendar, get news updates, sports scores, order pizza and even play some fun interactive games with Alexa.  Amazon offers a huge variety of ""skills"" that can be enabled on your Dot and that list continues to grow as more companies offer these interactive options which are similar to apps for your smartphone.Ease of use:One Dot can cover a large size room for voice recognition pretty well.  The only time that I have had an issue is when it is placed too close to the speaker and it is trying to hear me over the music.  I have purchased multiple units and have them throughout the house.  I also have one that I put in my office at work. I'm constantly amazed at how accurate it is at understanding what I am saying.  It very rarely has trouble understanding me.Conclusion:It is hard for me to imagine not having this very useful item around now that I have become accustomed to it.  It is one of the most useful things that you never knew you needed.  Of all of the Alexa options, I would pick the Echo Dot based solely on its versatility and low price point.  It has all of the functionality of the full size Echo and you can pair it with a high quality Bluetooth or wired speaker system for better results than you can get with the Echo alone.  I would and have bought this product again.","December 30, 2016"

It does well with simple things - 'Tell me the weather tomorrow', 'Give me the top news', but if you ask it anything a bit more complicated, it is 50/50 if you will get a response or not.  Alexa has even stopped saying 'Hmmm...I don't know the answer to that' and just gives me this stupid 'ding...and nothin.'  I asked her today - ""Is there a snow delay for the Philadelphia School District today'...and got the very annoying 'Hmmm...I can't find the answer' response from her.  I tried it multiple way, and nothing worked.  Since I couldn't get Alexa to tell me if my son's school was closed or delayed due to snow, I had to find my laptop and look it up.  So when I found my laptop and realized he did indeed have a 2 hour delay, I took this time to write the review.  I gave her 2 weeks to make me happy,  she isn't getting any better.","January 6, 2017"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Darkshadow","Not quite ready for prime time... yet?","""Alexa, go *&!$ yourself"" is usually where I end up after a few minutes arguing with Alexa to perform some basic task I've asked her to do many MANY times before. This time, however, she doesn't under stand what ""living room lights"" are. She responded accurately to that request, ""That's not very nice!"" Since she can take and understand an insult, I feel comfortable anthropomorphize her, and will there for continue to refer to Alexa as a ""her"".Anecdotes aside, here is the quick and dirty on Alexa (Dot or Echo, as I own many of both).Alexa responds very well to commands. When she responds, she understands most commands the first time. ""When"" she responds, ""most commands"" and ""first time"" are the problems. Periodically she simply ignores me. Her little lights flicker, showing she hears me, yet the eventually dim as I speak, or a few seconds after I finish speaking. This happens in loud or pen-drop quite rooms. I don't know what causes it. I've tried resetting her, this works some times, but not all the time. I've tried sleeping on it, and she ends up working fine in the next day and for a while. I don't consider this acceptable. I've lights, thermostats, and other devices connected to her, I've abandoned remotes and the idea of finding switches on plugs, or the inconvenience of  getting out of bed to turn off the bedroom lights. I'm committed to this automation process; be it Alexa, Google, or whatever frustrates me the least.""Most commands"" is the next problem. Alexa can do a lot of things, but simply not enough things, and with less variety than we require. Devices and software works well when we know what we must do to get it to respond the way we want. While I'm impressed with the variety of ways I can tell Alexa change the volume on her music, ask her some basic question, or tell her to go #$!@ herself, I'm still more than disappointed with the simple stuff that requires -I- learn her commands, rather than her know mine. Friends and family must be instructed on many of the commands, and I dislike having to keep a cheat sheet on how to turn on my kitchen lights.She does respond correctly MOST of the time, the ""first time"", however, if I forget which sentences work or what something is called, she simply doesn't have a clue. I don't expect perfection, and in the regard she does hit the mark more than miss, but, well, just look up that video of the kid asking to play a game with her and getting a list of pornographic positions... I've not experienced that harsh a misunderstanding, but enough to make you giggle... but only the first time.The devices Alexa can control is a VERY short list; this is one of the biggest reasons to avoid getting one of these novelties. It's novel to turn on and off lights (though expensive for an entire house), it's nice that I can play music (though only that which I have on Amazon Music), and control the thermostat (though, as I write this, to the command, ""Alexa, set thermostat to 74"", I get ""Sorry, that device is not responding to commands"" - since it responds to the Honeywell App on my phone, I assume it's her fault; I am troubleshooting it between paragraphs). Alexa still can't control my PS4 or XBox One, nor my 55"" Panasonic TV, nor can she do a thing with my computers. I am able to control all of these using various other devices. Simple not with Alexa alone, and this is a Lord of the Rings kind of situation... There must be ""One voice controller to rule them all,"" for voice control to be successful. Voice control is the universal remove of the future.Price wise echo hits the spot. Though, I was definitely not a part of the ""buy 5 get one free"". I'm, not sure what mansion Amazon things I live in, or if they think I will start stuffing them in stockings or under trees at Christmas; I now own 3 total devices. And how the interact among themselves is not something for Amazon to be proud of...Today, while talking with my roommate in the living room, I hear Alexa talking to no-one-in-particular, about 3 yards away in the kitchen. Clearly, since the house is quite except for our conversation, the kitchen Alexa though she heard her name, while the living Alexa not 3 feet away, remained silent and obedient. ""What WHAT!?"" While her shared algorithm failed in one place an not the other, who can know? It kind of makes sense that distance, and reverberation might have changed what was said _just enough_ for it to sound like ""Alexa"" in the other room... but again, hardly a success. This hasn't happened often, and even better, usually the closest Alexa responds, however, even when this works, they are three people and not one...Each Alexa has their own alarms, and song playback history. They are different and unique, and this is bad! Here is what my voice controller MUST do: It must know what room it's in, even if I must tell it, ONCE. It must let me tell it where devices are, which rooms, which house... I should be able to tell it to ""turn off all living room lights"". It should know I have _lights_ in a room called _livingroom_, and be able to control all with minimal setup and fuss. While I can add groups in Alexa to do this, it's tedious, and disappointing. And more to the point, this lack of software capability explains why I can vace ""Alexa, play my 90s playlist"" in the living room, then walk to the bedroom and tell the bedroom ""Alexa, resume my music here"". Additionally, it would be a bonus if Alexa could either recognize who I am by voice, or _at least_ let me reference the activities of other devices by location, ""Alexa, transfer music from living room"" while I'm in the bedroom.I have read up on other devices that can interact with Alexa, but I'm not going to consider the need for super expensive stuff to enable controlling a device as a ""success"". The future in universal remote voice control is approach-ability; if it's prohibitively expensive, far too expensive for what you actually get (such as the expensive Logitech device I'd need to control my TV at the moment; well except by using my PS or XBX directly). And finally, the ability for the average person to setup and control anything with Alexa without the need for a degree in computer science.The summary to this all...While Alexa, Echo and Echo Dot are impressive and useful, I have not committed to Amazon as the supplier for the voice control I've been desiring since the first time I watched Startrek The Next Generation. I gave Alexa this much time, and money, and got this far because Amazon is a company I tend to trust for quality and not to abandon their efforts. They seem to do things ""the right way"" and ""all the way"" enough of the time that I don't mind committing, after some deliberation, to what ever technologies they offer. However, as it stands, I am concerned with the lack of high impact progress with Alexa and Echo, besides the ability to order stuff from Amazon. I am still hoping to see some improvements in the next couple of months (as promised when this product first arrived) to substantially increase the stars on this review. However, with two stars I am saying there is promise, but I am anticipating finding another vendor and boxing up all of these Amazon Dots, and putting them in the basement next to the VCR, Xbox Connect, and pottery wheel. Please Amazon, don't disappoint me.","April 8, 2017"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Jacqueline","Alexa is an Adventure Into Artificial Intelligence","This review will not show ""verified purchase"" because the Dot device was a gift, and it may not show Vine Voice (though I am) because I did not get it via Vine.I initialized The Echo Dot Alexa with the iPhone app downloaded from the app store.  To do this, you plug the Dot into an electrical outlet (it comes with a USB charging cord and a transformer plug that is a slim lump that may fit most power strips even when full.  The transformer is tall and square with rounded corners.)  Then you launch your browser on your phone or tablet (in this case Safari) and put in the URL printed in the pamphlet that comes with the Dot.  The page has only one link showing, but apparently it will take you where your phone downloads the app from.  For me, it went to the Apple app store.You then click to download the app.  I noted the Apple app didn't have many stars for a rating, and it seems true it needs some work.  It gave me some puzzlement, but I've done a lot of similar things and eventually prevailed.  I wanted to connect a bunch of bluetooth speakers around the house, but did not (yet) find a way to tell Alexa which speaker to use.The instruction video that comes inside the app spoke nicely from the first speaker I tried to pair the Dot with, and then when I went to issue commands, I thought nothing was happening, no sound.  But no, Alexa ""woke up"" a speaker I had turned off in another room, and was playing a radio station that she chose through that other speaker I couldn't hear.So I moved the speaker Alexa seems to prefer to the room where the Dot is so I can see the blue rim light up when I speak to her.  In the process, I stopped and explained what I was doing to my husband -- and said ""It is playing because I told it to.  To stop it, I have to say, ""Alexa, stop!""  -- whereupon Alexa (in a room down the hall) stopped playing music through the speaker in my hands.  Whee!!!  It works, now all I have to do is learn to work it.  She played the NPR news that's set as a default, (which I don't yet know how to change) and increased the speaker volume on command.  Many adventures to come.I know people who love this service, so I expect it will take over my life.  On the other hand, I know people who are leery of the invasion of privacy potential, so maybe it will take over my life very slowly.  Anyway, since I stole my husband's speaker, I have to get him a new one or figure out how to make Alexa talk through the speaker I choose.  I have a lot of bluetooth speakers around the house - nevermind the car.","March 30, 2017"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Anna O","Kindle issue fixed finally, but Bluetooth frustrations abound","Updated March 31, 2017This device has really been frustrating. Bluetooth works poorly. My device connects to my stereo system, has the name of my Dot on the stereo's screen, but content continues to play out of the Dot and not the speaker. If you ask Alexa to connect to Bluetooth, she will tell you there are no BT devices available, but she is connected to the one you have. Telling her to disconnect and then trying again has the same result. Any time I want to use BT, I go through this ridiculous process and then have to unplug the Dot, wait a minute or two, and try again. The majority of time it works after that but you should not have to jump through such hoops to use BT on this device.The build quality of the device is good except for the power receptacle on the back. I have THREE of these devices and on every one of them, the socket is buried inside the case and not aligned properly. Right out of the box I had to jiggle and prod the cable and get it just right in order to plug it in. This problem is so noticeable because of the BT issues I have. Had BT worked as it is supposed to, I would have plugged in the device once and let it be.There have been so many disconnects and ""I'm sorry, I can't do anything now"" complete with a red ring. My internet service is working fine when this happens and sometimes the device says this for an hour or more. Listening to radio at night always results in the device just shutting off for no reason and you have to repeat the request to play whatever station you were listening to.It's a good device but is obviously not truly ready for prime time in my home. Perhaps others do not have these issues. That's great if it's the case but it does not negate my experience or anyone else's. After all, these reviews are designed to present the experiences of the actual user, of which this is one.Amazon's customer service finally fixed my Kindle issue and after that it began to work, so if you are having Kindle read aloud issues, email their tech support. They said they ""sync'd my Kindle library"" which sounds like something that should have been done automatically once I signed into my Amazon account and set up the Dot, but at least it works now. I'm leaving my original review intact in case someone searches for kindle issue type problems in the review so they can see that there is a solution at at least worked for me.Original review:This would be a 5 star review if it worked properly. I have two devices (each with different names) and neither of them will read my Kindle book, which is the primary reason I purchased these devices. When I use the commands listed on the instructions page in order to read a Kindle book, she says, ""I cannot find [book title] in your Kindle Library""; however, if I open the Alexa app, all my books are there under Books Alexa Can Read and she will read one if I tap on it in the app. After manually opening a book in the app and closing it, if I say ""Alexa, read Kindle book"" she will accept that request and say ""Resuming...."" and reads that book. That's useless though because I typically read several books at a time and cannot use voice commands to choose the books. My first interaction with Alexa reading a Kindle book always has to be me manually opening the app, tapping on the book, having her read it and then stopping her. Then I can resume that book only with voice commands.I got in touch with support and they requested a ton of information like my internet provider, all of the ISBNs of the books I am having trouble with, the exact phrasing that I am using with Alexa, my time zone, and the dates and times this happened. I provided that information and it still does not work. They have said they are no longer able to troubleshoot this issue over email and asked that I call them. I will get around to it, but fear they are only going to suggest that I unplug it and plug it in again, reboot my router and WAP and so on, which I have done repeatedly to no avail. If there was a magical key combination to reset or fix this issue, I'm sure they could have emailed it to me. It's quite frustrating.I would give this five stars if it worked as advertised.","January 16, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer - Vista, CA","Novelty vs Necessity?","I purchased 1 Echo and 2 Echo Dot over the holidays with the interest this is a worthwhile investment, and to see if it provides a benefit to my lifestyle.  Simple installation and up and running in no time.  I have some experience with Tech stuff, Networks, Windows and Android product. This is my first venture into Echo. And I was excited to try it since I’m a Prime and Amazon Unlimited Music userOverall Internet searched asking questions on facts easily found the responses I get about a 50% hit on finding what I’ve asked for, 50% of the time “I Don’t Understand the question.  Ask the same question on Android and I get better responses rates.  Google/Android allows for follow on questions on the same subject matter.  Amazon this need to be swiftly Improved to stay in the game, or at least stay in my house.Music Search, the Echo has a great sound quality for a small device.  With Amazon, Unlimited it provides a wider song selection.  My wife and I can spend a couple hours selecting sounds in an evening vs some mindless TV shows.  It does seem to have weakness.  Many times, it has trouble figuring out the song and artist match up, plays some knock off artist of the song version or plays the live version vs the original album version.  It can be frustrating to get to the right song each time.  And at times to critical on the Artist name…Example Echo can’t seem to figure out“Bob Seger” You must say “Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band” And that is a mouth full where as many times Alexis drops before you get the song name and artist out.  There needs to be more format in the song request process, ask Song Name, Artist and Album if known.  Alexis drops you and you must start over …  More Intelligence is needed here.Shopping …I did not buy this device to shop on Amazon.  Only Benefit is you can add items to your shopping card for later reviewHome Automation.  I use Wemo switches and Bulbs.  Creating Group names helps immensely.  Over all works well …. But if you have two homes it tends to comingle the devices on one. There’s several weakness, there is no smarts to use the Dimmer on the light bulbs, you can’t ask the status of a switch, are you on or off.  Nor is there an ability to tell Alexis to turn on a light for a specific amount of time.Nest Thermostat is a hit or miss.  It fails most the time.  Many times, Alexis reports cannot find the device or tells you it is in a mode it cannot be adjusted, which is not true.  I never us away.  You cannot have two homes with Nest named as Hallway.  It is not smart enough to use the second label such.  Nest or Amazon needs to have the option to ask status and report current temperature and set temperature.  Otherwise how do you validate the number for degrees to change to turn on the AC or Heat.  This function is of no value as it works today.Other Weaknesses.  You cannot ask the Echo down stairs to set and Alarm on another Echo in the bedroom. You cannot set a timer and ask it to report on multiple devices, you cannot cancel a function or Alarm on another device.  Example the I awoke this morning early and was down stairs when the upstairs echo Dot alarm set went off.  I had to go upstart to cancel.  There is no value in the Reminders and To-Do …  It seems not to play them back you must go to the App.This is not a review of Google vs Amazon.  Both have some issues.  But I would have expected Amazon to be further along than this.  This issues above lend to trying other vendors down the road.  Odds I will have sent up my second home with Google since there is no clean way to configure two locations and limit to only local devices  So my Subject of Novelty vs Necessity?  I’m heavily on the novelty side now.","January 27, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Carol","Love these!  Update---not sure I like what they are doing--invading our privacy is not OK","After hearing that Amazon refused to cooperate with police on a murder case, I began to wonder why the police would think that the Echo product would have captured anything that had to do with the murder if they haven't said Alexa first. So I started looking at the history of the things that these devices record on a regular basis... Things that don't start with Alexa. There are little Snippets of Our Lives recorded throughout the day. Not things that we ask Alexa to do, but recordings of television shows we are watching,  conversations we are having,  things that we do as we go about our lives. I'm not very happy about this. I was under the impression that the only time these devices we're doing anything was when we prompted them with the wake up word Alexa. That is far from true. I don't know how many of you are aware of this, but you need to look on the Amazon website at all of the recordings that your devices are gathering. There is a place where you can delete them, but it's not like they advertise that anywhere. And I have to wonder even if you delete them are they really gone? Can they restore them and listen to them? And what is the purpose for them doing this in this deceptive manner? I have to decide what I'm going to do about this. I have three of these devices, an echo and two Echo dots.. Plus, I purchased an echo dot for my son and his family for Christmas. I find it interesting that the government cannot listen to phone conversations of suspected terrorists, but Amazon can intrude into our lives in this way? They need to stop!!! They need to fix the software that runs these things so that they are not capturing Snippets of things that they have no business hearing. This is a total invasion of our privacy, and I am considering cancelling my account with Amazon, including Prime. I have been an Amazon customer for many years, and I now believe they have become way too powerful, and they think they are above the law, and that invading our privacy is ok. It is not!First I bought an Echo.  But, I found myself moving it up and down the stairs almost daily because my voice and it's sound wouldn't reach that far.  So, I bought an Echo Dot to put downstairs and hook up by bluetooth to the speaker bar for the TV.  I had to buy a little gadget to make that work, but it all works like a charm.  I was so happy, that I purchased two more--one for my office and one for my son and his family.  I also bought them a Prime membership so they can enjoy all of the benefits of Prime as well as the free music.  I love these things!","January 7, 2017"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Eduardo Neecha","Both exhausting and annoying to use, returned it pronto","First off, the Alexa app failed to work properly on my Android tablet (Google Nexus 7), gave up after 3 attempts of installing and uninstalling and reinstalling.  Amazon's ""spinning circle of death"" (just like Apple's ""spinning wheel of death"") basically would never stop spinning and totally froze up the app every time!  This was a bad omen for things to come.Finally had to use my laptop to set up this device, and even that took a bit of aggravation and delays.  Not nearly as smooth and simple as claimed.Once finally set up, the Echo kept getting disconnected from my wifi even though my other wireless devices (laptop, tablet) were fine,so I knew it wasn't my router or wifi carrier's fault.Generally speaking, whenever it did work, I found this device to be exhausting and annoying to use with all the delays.  The lag between saying ""Alexa"" to making the command to waiting for the command to be executed, was just way the heck too long.  The only things that seemed somewhat snappy were simply queries like ""What time is it?"" or ""How's the weather for tomorrow?""  It also seems to understand a dismally small range of commands, even compared to the voice-driven Google app on my tablet.I bought this device mainly because I use Amazon Music a lot, with my Prime membership.  The Amazon stream includes about 10-20% horrible songs that I have to skip over such as playing (gag!) ""smooth jazz"" garbage in the middle of ""traditional jazz"" stations.  (It was more like 40% crappy tracks in the beginning, until several weeks of my ""thumbs down and skip"" commands on various tracks improved things a bit.)  I bought the Echo Dot hoping that I could down-vote/eliminate the crappy content and ""add to library"" the good stuff, without needing to run back and forth to my computer all the time, since I run my computer's audio output to my music receiver and speakers.(Wish they'd make some kind of RF remote control for the Amazon Music player, I'd happily pay for that!)Also, I don't think the Echo dot has much onboard memory, judging from how often it would pause and stutter while streaming music---suggests that there is really not much buffering going on.  Simply outrageous considering how cheap memory has been for the last couple years.  Streaming was much smoother and reliable on my computer.Just not ready for prime time yet.  I guess they are having consumers beta-testing it, just like Microsoft does with every new version of Windows.","November 30, 2016"

I did not order the dot so I could control lights and appliances.  I ordered the dot so I could ask questions.  This is the area that it falls short in.

I told them I had tried that several times already, but it kept coming up with an error.  Gave them the error code.  On several discussion sites it stated that the error was supposedly in the registration server and that other folks had success calling into support and having the registration manually pushed through.  No such luck with me.  Finally got to someone who was going to help me get it replaced.  BUT FIRST....  You guessed it....  I had to go through all the troubleshooting steps again.  For....what?....

Downfall is that Alexa can't answer a lot of questions and it doesn't always register what you say. I would suggest moving it away from the TV so Alexa commercials don't set it off or make it difficult to hear your requests.","March 17, 2017"

But if I was buying today, I would buy these and put one in each bedroom, kitchen, bathrooms, etc. I have that now but with the different devices because I bought them as soon as they were available. But these are affordable and awesome Echo Dots and I recommend them highly. I wish they came with a year of Amazon Prime included for about $15 extra and they would be the best gifts ever for about $65.00. Highly Recommended.","December 12, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Brandon","More Than I Expected","At first I was skeptical about the whole line of Alexa products, but I ended up buying the echo dot for my girlfriend for Christmas and we both LOVE it.First off, the setup is very easy. I even paired it to a smart light within 10 minutes and was able to control it by voice no problem.One of my favorite features of the echo dot is being able to tell your echo to play you music and she will play music that relate to your amazon music likings. It awesome to be able to just say play me a song and have it playing in 2 seconds vs having to fidget with connecting your phone to your Bluetooth speaker and then having to select the music.The echo dot also has a bunch of very useful features, some of which include:~Setting an Alarm~Settin a timer~Telling Jokes~Smart House~Asking for the weatherThere's a ton more awesome things your echo dot can do but those seem to be the most used for me.The sound is adjustable and can be set very loud so that's not a worry.My only wish for the next model is to add a battery so that you can move your echo dot around if you want too, also if the power goes it, sometimes the echo dot doesn't reconnect to the wifi automatically.Every time I say ""Echo"" it responds unless there's a lot of background noise happening. In that case I have to raise my voice a little bit. I found the commnd ""echo"", worked better than ""amazon"" or ""Alexa"".Lastly, it looks GREAT. Amazon did an amazing job with the design and looks wonderful on my nightstand, especially when the blue ring lights up.This product is awesome and the sky is the limit for you. Whether you're creating a smart house, or you just want to hear a couple jokes here and there, the amazon echo dot is a great product and I would recommend it!","January 9, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","gd","Cool but frustratingly limited","There is a definite novelty factor to the Echo Dot and what  questions Alexa can answer. And it does offer a few convenience features. But it won't be long until you realize the Echo Dot and Alexa have a few shortcomings that prevent Alexa from transcending from a novelty item to a real productive virtual assistant. First, Alexa is all pull and no push. By that I mean the Dot is able to reach out and talk to other devices and cloud services when you initiate that conversation, but devices and cloud services cannot initiate the conversation themselves without Alexa reaching out first. This lack of support for push communications is very limiting. For example, take Alexa's ""reminder"". Say you would like to be reminded to take recycling out Tuesday mornings before leaving for work. All Alexa can do is add a ""to-do"" note in the Alexa app, and on Tuesday morning you will miss recycling again because the Dot won't notify you unless you ask Alexa what is in your to-do list that morning. That's just one simple use case that could easily be remedied by supporting push communications.Another shortcoming is Amazon's lack of a cloud productivity suite of its own thlo easily integrate with Alexa and support new skills.Finally, not a design flaw but still worth noting, Alexa does not offer voice based authentication. That is something important to keep in mind if you plan on having people over, as anyone can snoop through your to-do lists, shopping lists and calendars without your permission. I don't think anyone offers this level of security right now, so it's no surprise. But it would be nice to see Amazon break ground in this front first.Overall, this is a very cool product at a good price point. But the technology and the Alexa Skill Kit SDK is still very limited, so keep expectations low and you won't be disappointed.","December 29, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Mic S.","It's ok... Not amazing...","I do like my Dot and it does make some things more convenient. However some things that you would think would be very simple she simply cannot do. For example, I started playing music at 100% volume, when I needed it a little quieter I said ""Alexa, set the volume to 50%"" and she had no clue what I meant. I had to go and search how to change the volume by voice and in order to change the volume you have to say ""Alexa, set the volume to (a number between 1-10)."" That's the only thing she understands for volume control. I have only had the Dot for one day so I have not run into a whole lot of other bugs yet. I am currently in the process of getting smart switches for my lights and a new thermostat for all the smart home automation and I will update my review once I get all of that.EDIT on 12-10-2016: I now have 7 of these setup in my house and my review is now going down to 3 stars (started at 4). The reason for this is again, simple things that you would think would be easy, Alexa cannot do. Another example, I have all my Dots named in the app (Kitchen, Livingroom, Loft, etc.) When I start playing music on my kitchen dot you think it would be easy to say ""Alexa, transfer the music to the loft"" but of course Alexa has no idea what you are even talking about. I have tried phrasing it differently and I came to the realization that no matter how you say it it's not going to happen. So if I like a song that is on I have to wait until that song is over because if I go into a new room I have to start the music over even if I choose the same station (through prime music). I have also tried playing music by saying ""Alexa, play pop music on all dots"" and again, no idea what I am saying so I tried phrasing it ""Alexa, play pop music in the entire house"" but she doesn't understand that either. I also took my review down to 3 stars because they say that if you have more than one echo dot within ear shot they automatically know which one you are closest to and only that one responds, this is true 95% of the time. However, I have on more than one occasion asked my kitchen echo dot a question and then heard the dot in the living room giving me a different answer at the same time as the one that I am closest to. For the most part I like my dots, but they really need to do some updating I think.","November 30, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Paul","Fun, Cheap, Flawed","Amazon gave people a reason to try out home AI this year when they released this product, a standalone/tiny version of the larger Echo.  I have used the Echo Dot for about 1 week and have found it to be a pleasant, albeit flawed, device.The only difference between the two models from what I can tell is size and sound quality.  This is to ignore the second, mid-sized ""Echo Tap"" which only has value as a portable speaker and is not suited for use within the home.  The way this product, the Dot, was advertised led me to believe it needed to be plugged into an external speaker in order to work however it does in fact have a built-in speaker and can be used by itself.  The speaker is neither loud nor dynamic but it puts sound in the room when you need it to.The biggest flaw for me is with Amazon's dirty policy of refusing to allow competing services to work on it's devices.  I pay for streaming music through Google Play; however I cannot use the Echo to access this music because Amazon wants me to purchase music from them instead.  At the same time, Amazon has the Prime Video service I pay for;  they do not allow my google devices, such as my Chromecast-enabled television, to access Prime video because Amazon wants me to buy a stupid Fire stick instead.  The real craziness here is that Amazon runs it's entire Fire ecosystem on Android because Google gives it away for free (so there really is no excuse).In the end, I want to recommend this device because it's cheap, it's well-designed, and it's the first step in the new wave of home tech.  But at the same time, Amazon's policy of exclusion really hurts consumers and hinders their own success.  If you are a person who uses ""competing services"" such as Netflix, Tidal, Apple Music or Google Play, you probably want to wait for a more universally compatible home AI.","January 3, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","travelgirl","So I've debated back and forth between the dot and the echo....obviously I ultimately chose the dot (2nd generation).","So I've debated back and forth between the dot and the echo....obviously I ultimately chose the dot (2nd generation). I'm glad I did. I wanted to try the whole concept out and the dot is letting me do just that.The dot is obviously significantly smaller than the echo, costs less, but I think (as far as my research goes) they work identically ...more or less (if you're talking specs...size/cost/a FEW features ie speaker size, etc). From what I can tell: everything else is the same. I've added a few ""skills"" to my dot, from the Alexa app (examining the scriptures daily JW...which I LOVE!!! Bible Glossary JW, Chef (substitution ideas), ESPN flash briefing...which isn't so ""flash"" more long-winded...like all other ""flash briefings"", trivia game, and a few others. I did find that some, although show to be ""enabled skills,"" aren't currently working...endless back/forth with Alexa as to whether they're actually enabled or not...she seems conflicted...so as I said some aren't working.She does awaken pretty easily usually, except maybe if/when I speak fast. I do love to use it when in the kitchen. ""Alexa, set a timer for 25 mins. Alexa what's the weather, Alexa play some Michael Buble, Alexa, how much time is left on my timer.? Alexa how many ounces in 3 1/2 cups? You'd be surprised with the things that could happen in just a short 25 mins of cooking....where your hands are literally FULL of food  (ie. breaded chicken gooey stuff!)I'm looking forward to more skills becoming available (ie. when you ask her to look up a recipe to a food item, and she can actually read it out to you. For now, she doesn't seem to be able to do this....I think maybe because she's not able to ""choose"" the one YOU""D choose???I'm also looking forward to the ""skills enabled"" kinks to get worked out!!!","January 12, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Jaye","Love it!  Few drawbacks, though.","I'm not a big tech junkie, but every now and again, certain tech items just seem ""right"" for me.  That was the case when I first heard of the Echo.  I researched extensively before deciding to purchase the Dot instead of the full size.  The only difference so far as I can tell is that the full size has a higher quality speaker, and since I'm not one to be overly concerned about sound quality, and don't like loud music, I decided to try this one.As for the speaker quality, it is far better than I expected.  All of the descriptions, articles, and reviews I read indicated that everyone with a Dot would have to connect it to a separate speaker.  If you like loud music, or are extremely concerned with a high sound quality, I suppose that's true.  But, after receiving my Dot yesterday, I don't necessarily agree.I expected to get about the same amount of sound out of this little gadget as I do from my Fire tablet.  Whoa!  It is so much more than that!  Now again, I know folks who like their music loud, and for that segment of the population, you'll want the external speaker.  I prefer music to be either mid-grade or soft background sound, and this more than does the trick.  I currently have it in a 180 sq ft room, and I personally cannot handle having it turned up to 10 (loudest setting) while in the same room.  My home is around 1300 sq ft, and with the Echo Dot on one end of the house, I can hear it at 10, though faintly, from the opposite end.  It's a long ranch house, so you get the idea I hope.Another positive is that setup was amazingly simple.  I'd received my Wemo plugs the day before, and they were a nightmare to set up - barely any instructions, and tech support was very difficult to reach.  But that's a separate review.  In any case, I was terrified I'd be spending several more hours trying to get this little thing set up, but quite the opposite.  Within about 5 minutes of removing it from the package, it was set up and linked to my Wemo switches!  Super easy, and not only simple but good instructions.Now on to the cons I've found so far.  First, despite what Amazon says, when the music is turned up, the microphones sometimes do not hear you speaking to it unless you shout.  That seems to be intermittent, though.I've added several ""skills"", and many of them have bugs or just don't work at all.  The one that I would find very enjoyable except that it doesn't work well is the Word Master game.  Alexa does not understand many of the words I say, and despite repeating them over and over again, I often have to just pick a different word.  I had the same issue with the Quick Event skill to add items to my calendar.  For some reason, she would not understand the word ""Thursday"" - although outside of this skill has no trouble with that word in general.I would also like to see a software update where you can spell a word if she does not understand, and then you can ensure it's accurate - especially when trying to add something to your calendar.My other complaint is that while Echo Dot is playing music, my Fire tablet which is linked to this device keeps its screen lit up.  I usually only have to charge my Fire once or twice per week, and yesterday went through around 80% of a full charge.  You can turn the display off on the tablet manually, but then as soon as you speak to Alexa again, it lights back up and you'd have to keep turning it off manually - which sort of defeats the purpose of having an Echo you can talk to!  I'd really love to see Amazon fix that, because I don't like the idea of draining the battery so fast all of the time and wearing it out faster than necessary.After using it for a little while yesterday, I decided to go ahead and purchase a Sensi smart thermostat to use with it.  I will be buying other Smart Home gadgets to connect with this a little at a time.  And, I may decide to purchase a second Dot for use in my studio at the other end of my home.  All in all, I'm quite happy with this new little toy, aside from the few things I've mentioned.  I will add updates as any other issues or benefits arise!","November 21, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Linda","A bargain & Worth having, this little friend will grow as you add more compatible devices. WARNING for those with Family Sharing","Still has a few quirks and doesn't always understand requests the first time, but this is quickly becoming a welcomed addition to my home and quickly making Alexa indispensable! (Example of easy to use skills: turning the TV on or off, increasing or decreasing TV or Stereo volume, Setting a morning alarm, or setting a  timer ( great when you're cooking and your hands are sticky!), Turing lights on or off, or inquiring about the temperature or weather forecast. One of my favorites is ""Alexa, what my news briefing for today: You chose which news sources you want to hear. This is great while getting ready for work in the morning.I did knock off a star because there is ONE MAJOR inconvenience for those people who have family sharing: For example, my daughter and son-in-law and I have family sharing for our Kindle Libraries and Alexa CAN NOT separate my shopping list or do do list from theirs. You can ask ""Alexa which profile are you in?"" and she will tell me she is is mine (not my daughter's Amazon account"", but every command I give alexa, and every command they give alex is merged into the SAME HISTORY, even though we have SEPARATE  Amazon accounts. My news briefing and skills are separated from theirs, but ""To do lists"" and Shopping Lists are merged.  At this time, my daughter and I have agreed that SHE will use Alexa for lists, and I will use my iPhone Siri for shopping and ""to do"" lists.  In addition,  there isn't any privacy with your Alexa use if you have family sharing. It seems to allow you to change your profile to anyone on your family sharing and control their Alexa as well... Interesting, I could say ""Alexa, change profile to ""Daughter"" account. Then I could say, Alexa, turn on TV, and she would. A big negative if you don't have a lot of trust with who you've shared your Kindle Library with.","February 18, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Devyn Hart","WHAT AN OUTSTANDING INVENTION!!","What a great idea, and excellent execution! The idea that I can make a shopping list, or set an alarm, without interrupting my thought process to find some paper, or pull out my phone, is great! I'm jumping on to the wagon a little late, but the Echo Dot is very easy to use, and has tutorials and instructions to help you learn how to use Alexa's voice recognition properly. You can set dates or reminders in your calendar, and with the many skills currently out, and the ability to make your own (if you have the time and so desire) there really are infinite possibilities as to what Alexa can help you do; want to know how long your chicken has been in the freezer? There is a skill for that. Can't decide which workout you want to do today? There is a skill for that. Is the surf good this morning? Alexa can tell you. Forgot to shut off the lights down stairs? Alexa will do it for you (""The Clapper"" on steroids). I saw a really great story about a man completely bed ridden and unable to move. He was given the Dot as a gift and now has ""someone"" to talk with and play games. The doctor's even noticed an improvement in his overall health and mood since having received the gift. The Echo Dot has amazing potential.Really the only draw back I have found is that unlike its larger, more expensive counter-part, the Dot must always be plugged in to use. There has been a battery attachment developed that gives you about 6-8 hours of life (depending on usage), but if you find a good home for her to live it shouldn't be a problem for most. Also, if you will probably need one per room depending on floor layout and acoustic variables.open layouts may be able to utilize one for multiple rooms. Considering the price for one, though, even 2 or 3 wont break the bank, especially compared with all the other devices we use now.","January 4, 2017"

Basically I use it to set timers when I'm cooking, tell her to change the temperature on my Nest thermostat, sometimes to reorder stuff on Amazon, and to ask what the forecast is.  It is NOT like google where you can ask ""okay google, how long do I bake a potato?"" and it gives you an answer with time and temp for baking potato.  Alexa has no answers for you.  They keep emailing me cool things Alexa can now do, like give you funny answers to stupid questions, but I don't need her for entertainment.  I need hands free answers and directions.  There are some app type things you can download on her, like to order pizza from pizza hut or whatever, haven't used those.  Again, I just have a million random questions a day I need answers too, and she can't answer 9 out of 10 of them.I bought 2 of these when they were on sale for xmas, and over time realized I didn't like them.  Too late to return, or I'd return them and get the google version.Lastly, as I've become more and more disappointed by her presence, I get very angry if I ask her to do something and she doesn't hear me.  To avoid the anger, I just stay silent and get on my phone to do it, like change the temp using my Nest app.  It's like a sad, resentful marriage.  Why talk to you when I can just do it myself and avoid you?","March 29, 2017"

The one in the main room we use for music, timers, weather, and the one in the bedroom we use for waking us up, playing rain music while we sleep etc. Can't wait to use Uber on it and link it to our smart switches and smart thermostat. Can't beat the price for this hub. Prefer the echo dot over the larger one since most people would prefer listening to music through their sound system anyways.I like how you can turn the volume down and up, but I wish they made it easier than saying ""ALEXA LOUDER"" and ""ALEXA QUIETER"" it usually takes me a few ""ALEXAS"" to get the volume the way I want it. Maybe there is an easier way I just haven't found out yet.Also wish ALEXA had the capability to turn off an on my bluetooth speaker. Seems like our speaker has to always be on in order for ALEXA to use it. If there is a way to turn it off and on with voice control someone please let me know.I am sure that ALEXA will only get more awesome as updates occur, but it still deserved 5 stars even with the little kinks it has. Really hope Amazon makes a cheaper alternative than the harmony hub to be able to voice activate the TV. Fire stick you can only use the remote voice activation. I want to be able to turn on my TV and change my direct TV channels using ALEXA, but hopefully this will happen soon.This is a review after only playing around with it for a day or two.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Andrew V","Life changing gadget","Awesome gadget. The Dot is one of those things that you wouldn't ever NEED, but once you have it you question how you ever got by without it.The Good:1. Great for DJing, entertaining, or for your audiobooks...provided you pay extra for the various services needed to make those functions work well.2. Myriad of organizational features are super handy, especially since I work from home. To do list and calendar sync are useful, I am much less likely to forget to set an appointment when I can just shout at Alexa to make it for me. Weather, currency/distance/time zone converting saves me a lot of random googling.3. Surprisingly good at picking up commands from long distances despite background noise. Can hear and acknowledge commands even when I yell from in the shower.4. Easy integration with new devices, I didn't have any trouble setting several bluetooth speakers up as well as a LIFX bulb. Setting up the LIFX bulb was a pain, but Alexa found it immediately.5. The Dot is one of those devices that makes you think ""the future is now.""The Bad:1. To really get your money's worth out of it, you pretty much need a music service or audible subscription.2.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","AHJ42","I like it 👌","Great fun but effective.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the last fortnight, first with one, then two, and now four echo dots.The first communicates with my sonos connect, and allows me, via the sonos app to ask for playlists and music in any zone. It will be nice when sonos and Amazon get their act together and allow me to ask for music in any zone without using the app, or delving into what is now years old programming in order to ask sonos to play any playlist, album or song.Alexa talks to my hive system, and not only boosts my heating, but allows me to control and dim lights in several zones, and even switch off one of the two lights in my bedroom on the same switch, which shines in my eyes when I am reading in bed.I am now putting a Logitech hub in place to control various electrical outlets.The second dot is connected to a pair of speakers in my bedroom, but still allows me to control heat and lights.The third echo is connected to my portable foxl speakers, and allows me to stream music in any internet accessible location, including friends and family's houses, and hotels. I can't wait to show this portable system off to my friends at our next reunion. Is there a link to allow friends purchases to allow discounts on my digital purchases?The last dot is attached to the sound system at my girlfriend's place, which not only allows me to listen to my prime music at her place, but also can change the crappy music she plays to something sensible even When I am miles away😇I have yet to explain to her how to turn my heating or lighting in at my home, but I can do this from a distance, to annoy or distract unwanted visitors 😂In summary, a bit clunky, but full of potential","January 20, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","DrunkTown","First Week Review | Making your home Smarter","Black Friday came and went. Like me, you may have decided to hold off on the retail kayos opting to spend your day browsing Amazon instead of suffering through the large crowds. One of the gadgets that caught my eye was the Amazon Echo dot. It is basically a scaled down version of the larger wireless Amazon Echo. It was on sale for only $40, so I decided to give it a try. By Monday morning it had arrived.First things first, one of my favorite movies growing up was Smart House. I'm a huge fan of Home Automation and the smart home life. I had seen the Echo before, but not being a huge fan of Siri I figured it was just more of the same. That being said this thing is pretty darn cool.Getting Started:The Echo dot is extremely easy to setup. You download the Alexa app (Alexa is the echo dot interface, like Siri) pair it with your WiFi and you are up and running. It took about 5 minutes. The dot wakes when you say Alexa. You can then ask it basic questions about the weather, or give commands like ""turn on the lights"" if you have existing smart technologies. Through the back-end you can make Alexa smarter by enabling specific skills.Favorite ThingsGames: My wife and I love playing Jeopardy. The dot has a built in game that asks six questions updated daily. They are related to actual game categories that aired that day, but entirely different questions.Smart Accessories: If you purchase a smart switch, you can enable the dot to turn on and off your lights with a simple command. Since it is daylight savings time this is pretty awesome.Audio Playback: Audible books, music library, podcasts, ect are a simple command away from playback. Really useful.Making the home smarter is the trend this holiday season and it is only going to become more advanced in the near future. The echo dot is an entry level piece of technology that is a more convenient, and frankly a more useful version of Apple's Siri. Alexa doesn't know the answers to everything. It can be frustrating repeating yourself and rephrasing specific questions to try and get an answer. Nevertheless, when paired with a smart thermostat like Nest it can really make your home life more pleasant. After only a week, I bought four more!","December 7, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Richard Stone","Read this review, then buy it!","I love this little hockey puck speaker. Personally, I think they should have called it the Amazon Echo Puck. I suppose that might have been too Shakespearian. Anyway, it does everything it promises to do, and much more than I expected.It has no problem understanding me at all, which is more than I can say for telemarketers whom I instruct to never, never, ever call me again. I can call out its name from anywhere in my 5 room home, and it responds immediately. It even hears me when I'm in my bedroom with the speaker speaking loudly away next to my ear.It does so much. Some say another he-who-shall-not-be-named brand does more. I beg to differ with you, Some! Add in some skills and ITTT scripts, and it does everything I want and more. For instance, I use ""My Grocery"" with the corresponding skill, and it works great keeping me supplied with supplies for the above mentioned meager meals.To Echo or to Puck, I mean, Dot? The Echo has a good speaker built in, but the Dot, combined with a speaker, such as the one I purchased from Papa Amazon, Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 Next Generation Ultra Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker : Louder Volume 10W+, More Bass, Water Resistant, Perfect Speaker for Golf, Beach, Shower & Home (Black), is cheaper than buying the Echo and will provide good sound and portability. The Puck, aka Dot, is also less visibly intrusive having a much small footprint.The, uh, ok, Dot, will do so much more, including Hal-like control of most everything in my home, though I am not yet using it this way. It would be worth the price for me solely for controlling music and my shopping and ToDo lists. Thanks, Amazon, you done good!","January 9, 2017"

There is clear midrange and highs are present so the music is enjoyable through her.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","gardener97","OMG - I want one in every room","OMG - I want one in every room. You can think of any song you ever heard, ask Echo (or Alexa, you decide on the name) to play it and there it is - a real trip down memory lane or up to date new. This little Dot speaker is OK. No it is not the Bose Mini, but it is OK. (I actually have the Bose Mini in the bedroom) and if you have a second Dot in the kitchen you can just let the Dot speaker play and it is not bad. I LOVE being able to say ""Echo put appliance bulbs on the shopping list"" and next time I'm at the grocery, there it is on my list. I don't have to think about going to write something down. Questions? Yeah, you say"" Echo how old is Ruth Bader Ginsburg?"" and Echo says ""83, she was born..."" and you can either listen to the rest or say ""Echo stop"".There is a to-do list too. ""Echo, put oil change on the to do list"".  If you need to have more than 2 lists, you can get some 3rd party apps to build more lists.Skills: skills are like apps gone crazy. Like Skill Meow actually meows and drives your cat nuts. Tons of skills.You can build a huge library of playlists and music. You can upload your own music or if you are a prime member, there are about a jillion songs out there just waiting for you. You have to download the Alexa app and the Amazon music app. The music app is a bit squirrelly (to me) and I find building playlists on my computer works better than on the iPhone or the iPad. You need to be in the right place though - this url is gold! that would be music dot amazon dot com - and build away.Echo/Dot will also read your audible books to you, picking up wherever you last left off and you can say 'echo, back up a minute' or whatever too.Also you can just say “Echo, play some Mozart” and she will start right in. Or just say play classical, or smooth jazz or 60s rock. She will pull them off the huge amazon library. Once in a while she won’t have a song you want but I find if I say it again, or say it putting the artists name either in the front or the back of the request, she will find it. Also you can see your queue on the Alexa app so you can skip around.And she can tell you jokes. Not terribly good jokes if you are over 9 but cute.","November 17, 2016"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Mark A. Knowles","This is an excellent addition to my toy collection","This is an excellent addition to my toy collection, pretty much replacing my Chumba that has served me well over the years.  I just received it yesterday, and because the setup was difficult, that would be my first criticism and the explanation for 4 instead of the perfect score.  It took me a couple of hours + an actual chat with a very helpful customer service representative at 8:30 on a weekend morning – a chat that got me setup in a very short period of time (fyi, the problem was that my factory reset was incomplete last night – I had not pressed for a full 20 seconds on the two reset keys, and that has to happen to let the blue light go out).  But now that the Echo Dot is connected and registered, I'm just scratching the surface of all the power of this cute little device.  It comes with this very tempting offer for Amazon Music Unlimited for $3.99 per month – there's a free 30 day trial period that I've signed up for and am spinning up some pretty decent music with simple voice commands as I write this. My guess is that the Dot's other outstanding feature of commanding lights and other appliances connected to a smart network will be my undoing – the last remnants of my innocence and pride of being a hold-out against a Dick Tracy/Flash Gordon/James Bond world are precipitously being swept away.","March 5, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Hugh W. Cox Jr.","Ready for the Rookie league, but not the Majors","I have about 5 of these spread around the house.  Each of my bedrooms has one, my office, den and media room.  On rare occasions more than one will hear me, usually one will complain they can't understand me, and the other one will do what I want.  This is probably because the ones in my bedrooms are on Amazon accounts that belong to the person that resides in that room.  Each device is capable of turning on and off the lights in the house which is cool.Now the down sides.1. Apps are great for weather, flash briefing, but nothing of much more substance out there yet, but new skills are coming out regularly so hopefully the killer app for Alexa will be here soon.2. In the smart home area, you can turn things on or off, once she understands you, but you can't ask what the current status is.  So for example, I can tell Alexa to turn on the garage light, but I can't ask her if the garage light is on right now.3. Alexa needs to be able to read me texts, or other messages that are sent to me.  She needs to tell me, that she has a message for me and ask if I would like her to read it.  As with the other skills, this is a skill you would have to install and you would have to tell her that Yes you want her to read your email so this should creep people out too much.4. along the same lines Alexa needs an intercom skill5. Alexa's super microphones aren't all that great in a party situation, or even when watching a football game.  She just can't block out the competing noise I guess.6. A presence detector with the ability to know who is in a room would be wonderful too.  This could be done with a bluetooth tracker, or based on the smart phones near by.","January 9, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","M. Caroe","Great device for a smart home","I bought 2 of these on Amazon Prime Now, one for my room and one for the kitchen/living room and have physically  hooked them up to speakers I had, but wasn't using very often.  I hooked them up through the line out because the Bluetooth would cut out when they were hooked up that way. (The speakers are an HK Aura studio and a Bose color soundlink, both of which work with other bluetooth devices).  I took off one star for the Bluetooth problems because it may be a major drawback for some people.  Overall it has been great for me because it makes utilizing these speakers much easier.It is great for music and my daughter loves being able to get Alexa to play a variety of music with a voice command.  I use it for music as well, but I like the alarm, timer and shopping list features.  It is very handy to be cooking in the kitchen and tell Alexa to add an item to your list when you are in the middle of something. You can then view the list in the Alexa app while you are at the store and when you check the box, the Alexa app removes the item from the list.I use the weather and news features a lot.My house came with ecobee thermostats  (older version) but I am still able to control them with the Alexa ecobee skill.I have replaced my lamp bulbs and porch light with LifX color bulbs and am able to turn on and dim my lights with Alexa using the corresponding skill.  I can also choosee certain colors with Alexa.  (You can control a lot more colors and special effects with the LifeX app and LifeX bulbs don't require a separate hub ).This device is very functional for me and using it has already become part of my everyday  routine.  This isn't just a novelty device that will go in a drawer in a year.","January 1, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Joseph M.","Love the DOT, Love the Echo, my home is full of them, and also appliances that are controlled by both the Echo and Dot.","I own three of these and two Echo's. They all work in unison, but not totally. What this means is that I can give instructions to my Emerson Sensi thermostat from any of them, but when I ask for music, or other information, it only comes from the one that hears me.  I don't understand the people who  have trouble with an Echo or Dot, but then if I consider that some of them could be my 92 year old father, or someone who simply does not understand technology, it makes it easier to understand. The newer DOT is different from the original DOT, but no in any way that you should care. I have both. The original has the top that turns for the volume, just like the original Echo. I'm not sure if the Echo was changes as well, but the newer design has two push buttons that are recessed in the top, for volume up and volume down. The other buttons are to mute the microphone, and the other is context sensitive, this means that it does different things in different situations. If Music is playing, it can Pause the playback, and resume when pushed again. You can also do the same by talking to your Echo. Another use of that same button is for when you are configuring it for the first time. Load the Alexa app on a tablet, or computer to take care of your house full of Amazon Echo's and Amazon Dots. The Alexa app also manages my connected appliances, such as the Emerson Sensi thermostat, and the other devices that control certain lights, and other things that can be turned on and off via the power plugAs far as how the new DOT looks, it is a tiny bit shorter, but I had to measure them to see it, it is really close. The top ring that lights when Alexa is activated and waiting for you to talk, is the same. Also, the price has been as low as $39 here on Amazon, and in stores like Lowes and Home Depot, but that price fluctuates according to what Amazon wants, there is not ryme of reason to what they will do, and when they will do it.","December 7, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Cheyenne Boneman","Voice remote faulty after software update.","We've had the original Echo and the 1st Generation Dot and voice remotes for both. I recently ordered a six pack of the new 2nd generation dots. I hooked up one of the new ones. It works perfectly fine except for the voice remote. So I tried a second dot. Same result. The problem occurred on both new ones AFTER they downloaded and applied a new software/firmware update. (And I confirmed this with two different bluetooth speakers and two different Echo Voice Remotes on two different new 2nd generation echo dots.) What happens is when you (after the software update) press the voice command button on the remote, it may not respond at all on the first try after it has been idle for several hours. The second attempt it works ok. BUT if I give it another command thru the remote while it is playing a radio station or song, when I press and hold the voice command button it doesn't give us the feedback tones and it plays back broken bits of what's playing on the speaker while I'm trying to give it a command. It then may or may not perform the requested command. This does not occur if giving the dot voice commands directly to it and not via a voice remote. My technical background with computers and electronic devices tells me, thru all of my testing and resetting and plugging and unplugging, that this is a software issue that came thru with the update the dots have received shortly after they are activated for the first time. I have contacted Amazon Dot support via phone. My call was escalated to a higher tier tech support who agreed that this sounds like an issue that needs to be addressed with the Alexa software engineers. So he created a support ticket and suggested that I also write a review on the Alexa app. I give the first generation dots with 5 stars because they've been flawless. I give the second generation dots four stars because of this issue with the voice remote. As soon as this gets corrected, I'll gladly change my review to 5 stars.","November 22, 2016"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Boris","Surprisingly underwhelming.","I've received this device as a corporate gift, and glad i didn't pay any money for it. While its ability to recognize my voice is quite outstanding (despite my heavy accent) and it can hear me from pretty much anywhere in the room, thats where the good things end. ""Alexa, what are the nearest McDonalds hours?"" No info (which  Google map has). ""Alexa, play Eco 99fm on tunein"" - no way in the world i was able to make it recognize the station name (eco, not echo, not equal, etc), while there is no way to activate favorites by voice. It can play a tunein station, it can set an alarm, but it can't set a radio alarm, or even set a user provided alarm sound. Speaking about alarms, it has no internal backup battery, not even a small one. It will keep the alarms, but if the power is out during the alarm time you are probably out of luck. It supports custom plugins (called ""skills"") i have yet to try coding one, but ones already there are all activated using an awkward ""Alexa, ask <plugin name> to <plugin command> or by ""Alexa, open <plugin name>"", which then drives the dialog on its own. So, for example, to activate the nighlight plugin, you have to say ""Alexa, ask nighlight to turn on"", which is awkward and unnatural. This is a bad example, and a nightlight plugin is merely a hack, but it seems to apply to all ""skills"", of which none seems to be very useful to me. I have yet tl try the smart home stuff, but apparently, very few devices currently work with Alexa. BTW, try explicitly asking it to search on Google (Alexa, search Google...) and it will tell you it doesn't do that, promising you to search the answers on... Bing!PS: Nice little toy, extremely underwhelming firmware.","December 6, 2016"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Middlebunny","Pick one Echo product instead of purchasing all 3","I've been an avid Amazon customer since they started.  I have 2 kindles and was relatively satisfied.  I read all the rave reviews for the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap.  They seemed legitimate; however, I guess those reviewers either had low expectations or were incentivized to express those favorable opinions.  After going on an Echo Dot, Tap and Echo purchasing frenzy, I now have a total of 3 Dots,1 Tap and 1 Echo and am suffering buyers remorse.If you need or want to know the local weather or get  flash news updates on command, the Echo or Echo Dot are your devices.  I, on the other hand, use them for music streaming.  I find that the ""sleep function"" has flaws, voice recognition/comprehension needs great improvement and everyone should know that it is really unnecessary to buy more of these devices unless you have multiple amazon music accounts such that you can stream on those separate accounts from different locations/rooms.  Otherwise, users should know that the devices cannot be linked together for simultaneous streaming.  They also cannot be used by different parties to stream different music from each different device.  Apparently, Amazon Prime Music only allows streaming to one device at a time.The Tap cannot be used for streaming unless a wireless connection is available.  I wouldn't recommend connecting via an unsecured connection so unless you have a secure, mobile wireless connection, the Echo Tap is nothing more than an expensive, portable bluetooth speaker which you can purchase for much less than the cost of an Echo Tap.One might notice that the Echo, Echo Dot and Tap are often paired with supplemental bluetooth speakers with 2-3 item purchase combination discounts.  This is a very misleading promotion as it leads one to believe they can be used for simultaneous streaming.  That is not the case at all.  Unfortunately, the E-Dot only has a one-way BT connection.  Either you play music from the E-Dot or the BT speaker; but, you cannot play music from both.There are a lot of Applications for Alexa, the voice operated system used to operate the E-Dot and Echo.  Unfortunately, a lot of them have complicated wake phrases/statements.  If you don't phrase the statement exactly right, the app won't work and Alexa will not understand the command.  You can honestly spend more time trying to phrase things correctly to trigger Alexa then it might have taken for you to manually execute what you wanted to do like creating a shopping list, or recording water consumption.Another shortcoming with Alexa is the slow re-fresh rate of the application.  Sometimes, you have to completely exit out of it, stop it from running in the background on your phone and then reload it in order to get it to reflect your most recent commands or current ""now playing"".  In addition, there are other limitations specific to music streaming.  Let's say you want to stream a specific artist all day long to soothe a pet with separation anxiety.  If 1) you set the sleep timer for longer than you'll be away (ex. for 12 hours) and 2) Alexa confirms she will stop playing in 12 hours, that isn't exactly true.  Alexa will actually stop playing when she reaches the end of the artist's play queue which may only be 4 hours of music.  Theoretically, you can manually or verbally set Alexa to repeat the queue; however, I haven't tested this successfully yet.  It may only repeat the queue once rather than indefinitely until stopped by the sleep timer.My final Alexa app gripe relates to the repeat function.  Unlike the iTunes or Amazon Music apps, Alexa cannot repeat one song in a queue.  You'd think that toggling the repeat button 2 times would trigger this function; however, all it seems to do is toggle the repeat option to the ""off"" position.All in all, individually each product has its benefits so my rating is a low 3.  There is just no reason, other than needing a device in a location outside of the primary product's voice range, to purchase more than one device.  My thought is that the Echo-Dot is the most versatile of all 3 products; however, the Echo has better sound quality.  I have noticed the improved sound quality on the Echo; but, the improvement really doesn't make up for the price difference.  If I could do it all again, I'd invest in the Echo Dot for home and an inexpensive Bluetooth speaker for work that I can connect to the iTunes or Pandora applications on my phone.  That way, I will still be able to stream Amazon Prime music through the Dot at home for the stressed pet while playing comforting music in my office.","December 22, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Tsunemi K.","get an uber ride, find the weather","Extremely helpful device! You can stream music, get an uber ride, find the weather, find traffic and so much more. It may be a small little thing but (primary source quote) good things come in small packages, First let me start off with the speaker. The sound is very clear and crisp, which surprised me due to it's size and it streams so many music stations (IHeart Radio, Amazon Music Etc.) However i don't like how it doesn't stream itunes, i wish it could do that. However you can connect your phone via Bluetooth and play whatever you want. Second, The setup process and the Alexa app. The setup is easy using the Alexa app and it doesn't take long, only a few minutes. The app however, is not my favorite. Sometimes the app goes offline, for no reason even if you have a good wifi connection. The app frequently crashes, and i don't feel that there is not enough support in the app. However, you need the app to use the echo dot. Third, the skills. This device, has more skills than i have ever thought possible in such a small device. You can ask to play jokes, order pizza and much more. Another thing I like about the skills is the variety they have. Amazon put a huge variety of skills (and is still adding them) on to the echo dot so you can enjoy more. One of its skills in particular is the ability to control certain types of light bulbs and plugs. For this skill, you can ask alexa ""hey alexa, turn on the light"" and the light will be on. This is the end of my review i hope it helped. Amazon unveiled the future of smart home products with this device and if you are reluctant to get it because you are an apple fan, you are missing out.","January 12, 2017"

If you do not have these services, your Dot can function as a radio station by mentioning the name of the station or its exact frequency.NOTE: You can add 250 songs directly to your amazon account for alexa to play.Cons:-  Many skills only work within US. Some others work by mentioning the city in which you are.- It only supports English or German language.- obey any voice that says wakeup word. This is a problem when you integrate a follow-up system for your home. If your dot is near the entrance and your door lets the sound pass, it is very possible that someone outside your house will operate your system.- It must always be connected to the WIFI; If your router dies, say goodbye alexa.- When playing music, dot have trouble listening to new commands. This is aggravated if the horn is too close to the dot.","January 13, 2017"

We now have the Dot in another room and have been having a ball listening to music (Amazon Unlimited). The quality of responses from 'Alexa' are very clear and the Dot is able to pick up several voices without a problem. This is simply such fun technology. I would highly recommend the Dot, not only for all kinds of useful tasks, but for the high level of entertainment value. I plan to get at least one more. You will have a great time with this little marvel of technology.Oh...it is also very easy to set up and takes very little time to do so. You absolutely do not need to be technologically adept to get Alexa up and running.","December 2, 2016"

It has the brains of the bigger unit but it's just lacking in some regards. I've also not found a speaker system that I am dying to use it with... yet.

"1.0 out of 5 stars","Carla E. Malone","Don't purchase.","I love my larger Echo.  It works great.  I have it in my kitchen and it picks up from across the room.  I purchased the dot to go in my bedroom for use as my alarm clock.  It performs very poorly.  I bought this a few months ago but unfortunately we were moving so it got boxed up and we are just now unpacking it and using it for about a month now.  (So we can no longer return it)When the alarm goes off and I YELL snooze, it does not pick up my response.  I literally have to get out of bed, go to the dresser and put my mouth 6 inches from it for it to respond.  We moved it to the nightstand.  Still about the same.  I have to lean over and across the nightstand for it to hear me.  That may sound lazy, but why else buy something voice activated?Also we have the WeMo's for our lamps.  They work great with my Echo.  The echo dot is very spotty.  I have to ask it 3 or 4 times to turn on/off the lamp before it does.  Often it will respond ok but then does nothing.  Completely annoying.The sound it terrible btw.  Granted it is not a speaker like the Echo, but still... it's crappy.We have 2 Echo's that work great.  The Dot was a waste of money for us.  I don't recommend it and would return ours if we could.","March 2, 2017"

The only issue I have is that it doesn't always understand the word or words I am saying, but I get around that by rewording the question.

I haven't fully tested all the skills this dot is capable of but I'm sure my personal Jarvis is going to be fun to use in the coming months. The voice range is very good. Although while playing music asking Alexa would require you to be close to the device.","March 9, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Juice Box","Connectivity can be better but I still love it","I gave my Echo to my parents and replaced it with three 2nd generation dots. The dots make the Echo not worth the price difference since the only difference is the speaker. Even at 49.99 you could get a much better speaker than the one that is built into the Echo for the $130.00 price difference. It's good for older people like my parents who don't understand that and just think a speaker is a speaker. Anyways one dot is lined into my home theater and the other shared with the speaker I use for the pc when I want to use them for music. Having a dot in multiple rooms is great because you can voice control anything from anywhere in your house. I have 3 in a 1400 sq/ft two bedroom and do not need a fourth. Mine do have some connectivity issues and I find them unable to connect to the internet from time to time, an issue I NEVER had with the Echo. That wouldn't be an issue at all really if the Alexa app wasn't so horrible. I wish Amazon would partner with Apple or something because sometimes the app just refuses to work. Sometimes the dots won't update the internet connection either. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for it, sometimes the setup works the first time, sometimes it takes 5 tries, sometimes it takes 5 tries then I have to reset my router and hard reset my phone and try 3 more times. It should not lose connection in the first place and if it did it should be simple and easy to reset the connection. It's not.","January 4, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Marie Roman","Echo dot","It is great as an alarm clock (if you are a heavy sleeper change from the default sound), timer, weather, reminder to do list. After a lot of voice training, I mostly get ""I don't understand your question"". I use the card that came with it and the app I downloaded, to ask questions I really don't need to answer to. Today I asked it a question, not expecting an answer and it answered correctly. Maybe it gets smarter as you use it. I am keeping it and I also purchased the charger. I feel the price together brings it up, so get the charger only if you are moving it around. I got a white one. Looks gets a 5 stars with or without charger. Echo Dot get 4 1/2, it doesn't let you give it the half star, if it does, I don't know how to do it. Charger gets 5 stars. Worth trying and checking it out yourself. You can always return it, if it doesn't measure up but don't forget to check out all the features on the app. *If you can afford it get  the Alexa. Although for the price the Echo Dot is good, a hugre price difference but I hear the ALEXA is fantastic. I got it on Sale for 39.99 during christmas, can't complain there. I purchased 2. A black one for my son's birthday. He really likes the echo dot, her name is also Alexa. you are able to change the name and voice. I saw a video on you tube (which you should watch some video's) the man changed the name to Echo. I like that but i will keep the name Alexa. hope i was of some help.","January 15, 2017"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Ethan Wells","What I like: it responds very much like our Echo","What I like: it responds very much like our Echo, minus the high-quality speakers.What I do *not* like: the Echo and the Echo Dot's microphones come into conflict with each other.  I have our Echo in the kitchen, and our Echo Dot in our bedroom - which is on Another Floor.  On occasion - such as today - I will be standing *3 feet* from our Echo and ask it to start a timer because I'm cooking something.  No response from the Echo.  Then I hear, from my bedroom on ANOTHER FLOOR, information indicating that THAT dot has started a timer.This would be a mild annoyance if the two devices communicated between themselves.  But they don't.  Upshot: the kitchen Echo doesn't record the timer, while the bedroom one does, and so I need to go up to the bedroom to know whether the dish I'm cooking in the kitchen is done.No doubt this is a glitch.  But until it is fixed, it's a major one.*** UPDATE - 01/16/17***My wife and I use the dot to play white noise to our 3 month old infant.  Usually, it's great.  For some reason, however, recently, the dot has randomly begun playing music.  UPSHOT: our 3 month old is asleep, listening to the soothing sound of rain, and SUDDENLY there's some jackass bellowing about his lost love.  Baby wakes up, much love is (further) lost, and my wife and I end up shouting to the Dot to shut the f--- up.Worse: this happens in the middle of the night. We wake up, and there's music playing.  F-R-E-A-K-Y.  No clear reason why the music is playing....","January 15, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","june","Dot makes it easier to control smart house from the bedroom!","I love the echo technology.  Had a full size Alexa in the living room since it first came out.  All my light are connected.  Got the Dot for my bedroom.  Works great! Same as big one, except the speaker isn't as good.  I don't care...I misunderstood in the first place, and thought I had to have a Bluetooth speaker to hear her. I can hear her fine most of the time unless I'm in the next room.I also love the fact that I can use it as an alarm clock. I've had problems with my phone alarm not going off, so I love having the backup.  I can't say enough good things about it!Also, I didn't realize that you didn't have to set it up like you do the first one. It took a long long time to put all my lights into Alexa and make them work properly. When I got the Dot, I thought I would have to do all that again, but all I had to do was put it into my Alexa app on my phone and it was already set up for it! So easy.Dot has already paid for herself, as far as I am concerned. .. right after I got it I heard something outside my living room window in the middle of the night. I was really too scared to get up and go turn on the lights to see what it was, but all I had to do was whispered to my new Alexa and tell her to turn on all the lights in the house.  Immediately all the lights in the house came on... and I didn't have to leave the safety of my bedroom. What a relief!  If there was someone out there, they took off when all those lights came on.","December 7, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","M Polybius","This is the future","So far, after about a week, I love my Echo Dot.  Honestly, I wasn't sure if this was something I would like to have or not and bought it as much out of curiosity as anything.  The potential for the Echo and other voice activated devices is only just getting started but already there is so much that it can do.  I love the music and reading capability and the sound quality exceeds what I would have thought for such a small device but I did also purchase a Bluetooth speaker to go with it which helps in a large room.  Here is a list of the things I have used it for just in the past week:Weather updates, news updates, turning on/off lights (wifi plug needed) reviewing/adding items to my calendar, adding items to my shopping list/to-do list, listening to music, checking for unread email, playing Jeopardy, getting a cocktail recipe, reading a Wikipedia entry, setting a timer.  There is probably more that I can't think of.  I could honestly see getting several of these to put around the house.  One benefit that may not be obvious at first is that having one of these will (especially once the capabilities are expanded) will reduce the amount of time spent on phones and other portable devices.  Personally, I would rather talk to a computer using more or less natural language than staring at a screen.  The only capability that I wish it had now is the ability to take down a memo but I'm sure that is in the works.","January 11, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Rigid family setup options, otherwise love it!","Overall I love this idea, and it seems to be working pretty nice. Understands what is told quite well, even if I'm not a native speaker.But when it comes to productization - setup options, it's quite horrible! I wanted to setup echo's for my kids so they can benefit from my prime account as advertised on household setup page. Of course it is impossible. You can only join one person to a household account on echo dot. You cannot link your kids accounts there, so they cannot share a shopping list, they cannot access kindle books for instance.Of course I can setup echo dots under my account, then we'll have same shared shopping list, but unfortunately trackr skills, or lightify (osram lights) skills will then have shared details as well. Ie. find my phone finds my phone, not my kids. Turn on ""my"" lights turns on what ever I've configured in ""my"" group, not my kids. My kid cannot access her spotify account, only mine.Really bummed about that. Actually so much I'd like to one star this, but I'm hoping Amazon improves family setup.Apart from non-functioning family setup, adding skills is easy. Love the ability to add stuff to shopping list, controlling lights. In built speaker is very good! Connecting to bluetooth speaker worked well, no complaints on sound quality.Also the microphone sensitivity is amazing, it does pick speech from afar.","December 30, 2016"

I use it daily so I thought I'd buy the Echo Dot to supplement the original Echo. At first I thought you had to have a big Echo (not Dot) but I don't believe that the case. Secondly, when I was setting up the Echo Dot I had lot's of issues getting it to connect to Wi-Fi (kept saying it couldn't connect but appeared to connect). Also during setup, it appeared that you couldn't use the same wake phrase. You can use the same wake phrase as long as you aren't within the range of the other Echo. As you would expect, you don't get the same sound volume from the Echo Dot as you do with the full size Echo. I bought three of the Dot's and I've only got one working. I can't get one to connect to Wi-Fi and I've spent so much time working with the first two it took the drive out of me to try the third. I like the Dot and I'm sure that I'll get them working or the one that doesn't work replaced but it wasn't as easy as setting up the original Echo or the Fire TV's.From a personal observation, it appears that the signal strength on the Wi-Fi for setup may be the culprit but don't know for sure. To get the one Echo Dot working that I did get to work, I took the Echo Dot to where the Wi-Fi router was to configure it. After configuration I moved it to where I wanted to use it. I couldn't get the Wi-Fi setup to work from the location where I wanted to use the Echo Dot.","January 24, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Tom Maynard","Alexa gradually becomes more helpful, and welcome in our home.  *Maybe*a network issue [pending review]","Perhaps I'm simply impatient but if the Dot loses power it doesn't seem to reconnect to the network on its own.  The City is replacing light poles in my neighborhood and we've had two (brief) power outages in one week.  Both times our Dot did not automatically reconnect to our network, but to be fair I may have been impatient.  If it happens again I will sit on my hands and update this review after patient waiting.Otherwise I couldn't be happier with my Dot.  I'm not much for speaking to inanimate objects, but Alexa makes that somewhat easier.  I bought our Dot primarily in order to control a lamp in our finished basement (the primary light source in the main room).  ""Alexa, turn on the basement light"" is so simple to say at the top of the stairs (with an armload of laundry, say) so that problem was solved.  Then gradually the Dot has taken control of our sound system (Play), our selection of outerwear before dressing to go out (Weather), and so on.Heck, I'm even working on a recipe skill of my own to remind me of times/temps when I've got slippery/greasy hands in the kitchen.A regret: The Dot (and thus Alexa) can not control the Amazon Fire TV (or Stick).  It would be nice if I could simply ask Alexa to select a video rather than having to pick up a ""Voice remote"" and push a button to control my television.  Does anyone else see the irony there?","February 16, 2017"

Our company has enjoyed asking her to play yo momma jokes, to give us the weather and remind us what family events are happening each day. So far it's been  a hit. She has limited search capabilities, she does great with fact based questions. Ie. what is the largest mountain, What is the average life span of a s***zu ( yes we tried all these) but no generic search like- what dogs are the cutest( niece tried that ) . She does not answer calls - or text would love that in the future.  The music and news selections are great once you get use to how to ask her to play them. For example , Asking her to play this American life did not work until we said "" Alexa play the This American Life station"" , she needed the station -I can be pretty far away and she hears us.  The one thing that I would like to see is changing her name to something else. Every time we discuss the Alexa....she hears us and wants to interact. It would be great to change name to something that would not be said in conversation - so that she was not inadvertently responding.I don't think she will run my life -but I can see where if you utilize the tools she has it should help improve your life, and that's what I see as the benefit of connected devices, adding simplicity to very busy lives.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","ultra55371","Love this Dot!","I am really liking this device so far.  Ever since the echo came out a couple of years ago, I wanted one, but it was just a little too expensive to experiment with.  With the lower cost of the Dot, the option to use a better speaker system and all the benefits of the full size Echo, this was a easy purchase.I purchased the kit deal with the Phillips Hue Bridge and lights.  In addition, I purchased another 2 Phillips Hue bulbs and a Wemo smart plug.  the setup and installation of everything was very simple and didn't take long at all.  It is now very convenient to control the lighting in our our room and bathroom now.  The hardest thing to remember is not to use the switches anymore.Another advantage the Dot has over the Echo is the ability to use a better speaker system.  I hooked ours up to a Logictech Z623 2.1 speaker system and it sounds beyond awesome.  I have both a Prime membership and a Spotify account.  Listening to Spotify now is very enjoyable.There is a little learning curve on how to speak to the Dot, but we're all getting the hang of it.  I will be adding more Dots and other home automation devices to my home in the near future.  So far this has been a great experience and wonderful product.  I almost purchased the new Google Voice, but very happy I didn't since initial reviews are not that great and it sounds like they released it a bit too soon.  The Echo / Dot program has been around for years, has many partners and the possibilities are almost endless with these devices.  Very happy camper!","November 13, 2016"

If you ask what were the 13 original colonies, she'll have no idea what you just said. She's useful when she actually knows the answer that you asked, but the times with that are slim. The best uses I have for this is music, which I primarily use it for Pandora, as it drains my phone battery and is a little bit annoying to turn on my phone every single time I want to skip a song. The sound is actually really good unlike others to say. I generally listen to it at volume 7 in a 500-600 square foot space and it works well. I have tried external speakers, which work well just annoying for always having to turn it on and off. Another useful function is that you can connect your phone to it via Bluetooth. Which is an extra pro for it as it, therefore, is a Bluetooth speaker, and even a Bluetooth receiver if you have a speaker system that doesn't have Bluetooth. I have used this a lot but I still prefer wired connection instead of Bluetooth. Also, the only way to play a single song that you have in mind is through your phone, or through amazon music which costs money.Pro:PandoraSound QualityBluetooth SpeakerExtremely Basic questionsCon:Subscription fee for musicAnswers to simple questionsSecurity issue-Music","January 24, 2017"

Shortly after I unboxed the Echo Dot, it was hooked up and ready to go.Immediately I started testing it out.Right away I was impressed at how well it could hear me even from a great distance away.I was also impressed at how easy the WeMo light switches and outlets I had integrated into the device.I can't tell you how amazing it is to be able to say things like, ""Alexa, turn off the Back Porch Light"", or ""Alexa, turn off the Laundry Room Light"" and have lights automatically turned on or off just using my voice. Sure, I was able to control those lights with my cell phone, but to not have to reach for my phone, and just say what I want done is a whole new level of freedom.My wife particularly likes how she can set timers and alarms simply by telling Alexa to set it.I can't tell you how handy that comes in when her or I are in the kitchen cooking.There is so much we love about this device it has become very clear that we need more of them for our house and I am pretty sure we haven't even scratched the surface of what we can and will be able to do with this device.The possibilities are quite exciting.Great Job AMAZON!!!I will be buying more of these soon.","February 15, 2017"

I would definitely recommend it to anyone that plans on connecting to a nice bluetooth speaker or an A/V system because the speaker that is built in works okay to hear Alexa talk but when playing music it sounds like a tin can.  Fortunately for us we connected it to our surround sound receiver as an analog input via a 3.5mm to RCA cable.I installed the Logitech Harmony skill (the red one) and connected the dot to my Harmony Hub and it has been working out really well.  The one drawback of not using the Dot's built in speaker is you need to have whatever system you are using for sound turned on and the volume to a good level - the Harmony Hub resolves this issue for me.  I programmed an activity I named ""Sound"" through the harmony app that switches my receiver on and changes to the correct audio input.  Now I say ""Alexa, Turn on the Sound"" and I can hear the Echo Dot on my surround sound system.  Or the kid's favorite ""Alexa, Turn on the Xbox"" which is usually followed by me saying ""Alexa, Tell Harmony to Mute"".The Echo Dot also works Really well with the Phillips Hue hub and was very simple to set up.  Being able to walk in to my dark home and say ""Alexa, turn on the Living Room Light"" and have the light immediately turn on is awesome.  And so far - it works without fail!","January 14, 2017"

I've been using the Amazon Fire Line for a while now and I have to say this Amazon Echo Dot is by far the most useful device. I could CONFIRM that you DO NOT need the Amazon Echo in order to work this Amazon Echo Dot. Setup for this device was a breeze. Just plug in the power cable to the unit and download the Amazon Alexa app and you're all done. Not only can you use this device to play music but you could use it to set alarms. The microphone on this unit is really good and it can hear you from across the room. I've used this frequently when I cook, it makes it so easy to set multiple times for certain foods. It even tells you the recipe for the meals too. This little device is small and sleek and does not take up space at all. We use this device to check the weather every morning before heading out. There is so many things this little device could do, we hooked up our Nest Thermostat to this and control our heating unit all through voice command. This little unit carries LOTS of potential, there are so many other things we connected this unit to, we are currently controlling our house lights with this all by saying ""Alexa, Living room on"" and the TV by ""Alexa turn on TV"". Although the living room lights and TV functionality requires an additional add on equipment I still think this is pretty cool and is one step away from Jarvis from Iron Man.","January 6, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Marvin Lipschitz","...if your system was designed with flexibility I would own 4 Echo Dots and a music subscription.  So, I will only own one Dot.","Initially, I fell in love with this device.  When I tried to interface with Insteon, (the original reason for the purchase), I had difficulties. There was no specific information of how to speak to Alexa to get the lights to respond. I spent an enormous time reading how to setup Insteon and Alexa after it was set up. The information that I was looking for was not available.  I am still not quite sure what works. I have finally figured out what to name scenes to get Alexa to control the lights.  There were no instructions that really helped. Lots of instructions that provided no useful syntax information. Secondly, I have a whole house audio system.  I would have bought multiple Echo Dots if I could use one of them for the output of all of them.  I will cancel my new subscription to the music in favor of my Airport Extreme. From my iPhone I can choose any of the airport extremes to output to. One of them is in a closet with my whole house audio system.  I figured I could have 4 ethos in the house and could have them all output to a single source. Nope, so, I really have no reason to own more than 1 echo dot. It will only be used in my bedroom hooked up to a separate Speaker System. Can I use my phone as a control, no. Can I use my Music Subscription on more than one Dot, no. Does the remote work without pressing a button, no.  So, if your system was designed with flexibility I would own 4 Echo Dots and a music subscription.  Instead I will never own more than one Dot and no Music Subscription.","November 20, 2016"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Kenneth E. Martin","Be Careful What You Want","The Amazon Echo Dot is a LOT of FUN. I love asking questions, and hearing silly replies. My favorite is to ask Alexa to play music by genre. I learn new artist that I hadn’t known before. I will never use the ordering ability as I am not likely to order laundry detergent, paper towels, or mouth wash. Kind of a waste here.My biggest issue is, if you want to listen to music, which is the Dot’s forte, you HAVE to pay for a Amazon Prime account. I am not going to do this.The gift I bought for my wife, an Echo Dot, is limited to answering questions that may or may not be in the Alexa database, and she is denied any ability to play music other than what she already paid for on Amazon. I wanted to keep my Amazon account separate from my wife’s, but due to that, she can’t get anything from Amazon, even though I bought this for her and set it up under her profile.So, the Dot is cool, but it is designed to make money for Amazon. (Duh) The problem is, if you buy one, and expect to get what is promised on the page, you also HAVE TO BUY a Prime account. So, Amazon pretends that there is no subscription fee for using a Dot, or any other Tap or Echo device, but bear in mind that it is not something worth buying if you are not the Prime Account Holder. It is so limited that it is worthless.Google does NOT require all of this paid membership stuff.","December 27, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","John Classen","Most of the special features like ordering a Dominos pizza are not as cool as ...","Does exactly the same thing that the largest Echo does. Only the speaker size is different. The quality is still adequate for music. If you are a music quality snob then you still have the option of hooking it up to your stereo or whatever. I have purchased both the Echo and the Dot. The Dot is a real bang for the buck compared to the original Echo. The Tap (middle-sized) is the one that is slightly different than the original Echo or the Dot. I don't have a Tap, but I hear it has a docking/charging station; the advantage of that is that it can run unplugged using batteries; the Echo and Dot don't have that feature.Cons:Most of the special features like ordering a Dominos pizza are not as cool as you'd think. They are very limited in their flexibility/options.These are typically add-on installations you ask Alexa to setup for you or you can setup using your android device or Kindle.Alexa typically has problems answering anything other than the most basic questions.Pros:Listen to music (you can ""pause"", ""resume"", ); ask about weather, calendar events, basic facts, wikipedia topics; setup reminders, timers, shopping list, calendar events. Alexa can read books too, but I haven't mastered that; I'm not sure if you need Kindle Unlimited for that or not.My nephews' favorite add-on app: ""Ask for a Fart"".","January 2, 2017"

I was really touched by the reviewer who got the Dot for his relative with MS; just beautiful.  I think the simplicity of the whole platform is what impresses me the most.  All you need is the four or five Post-It-sized instructional pages to get up and running.  I didn't do any voice training, and yet Alexa hears me and responds from two rooms away!  The $3.99 Music Unlimited deal per month with a free trial is perhaps an even better deal than the incredibly cheap price of the unit itself.  I shared it with some friends over Christmas and they all want one.  Truly an amazing piece of hardware/software integration.  Congratulations Amazon!","January 2, 2017"

It recognizes my voice commands perfectly, but I have not fully utilized all the functionality as of yet. My one concern is the power adapter is an issue. Why could it not be either a slim design or a right angle to it. Putting this behind a dresser or bed causes the USB cable to bend. Is there a compatible Power Adapter that can be purchased? I would have given this product 5 stars if it wasn't for this.","November 27, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Zoey","Love, Love, Love!!","Love, love, love my echo dot! The set up was extremely easy for the dot, and is exactly what I was looking for! I originally was unsure if I actually needed the echo dot, but I am so glad I decided to try it it! I bought the dot to use with my Nest thermostat and Philips Hue lights. The set up of the dot with these two systems only took 5 minutes max, and it works perfectly. Now I just tell Alexa to turn my thermostat down or up, and she does it no problem! The same with the Philips Hue lights. On top of that, I did not even know half of the other things Alexa can do and how easier some things can be thanks to this product! Instead of trying to remember what groceries I needed when shopping, I now just tell Alexa to add something to my shopping list at the moment I realize I need to buy more! This has helped reduce those ""I forget.."" trips back to the grocery store!!! Additionally, she can set timers or alarms for whatever reason, tell you the weather, update you on what you have planned on your calendar for that day, and SO MUCH MORE!!! I found the dot so helpful, that I even purchased a second one for the bedroom. She even reads a bedtime story to my 4 year old son at night, which he just finds so funny because the main character of the story is him! Overall, this is a GREAT product and a must for those looking to help make daily life a little bit more easy!","December 28, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","pnh230","""Can Echo locate my keys?"" Nope. Nor can she speak dolphin.","Yes I have three of these.  Does each one need a review?  Who knows?  Maybe Alexa knows.  I would ask but I feel rejected when she doesn't answer my questions.  Not for lack of having the answer I'm sure, but because she cannot or will not understand me.  This is called selective hearing.  I am familiar with the concept.  I am married with children.  We all selectively block out questions from each other on occasion.  Alexa fits right in.  But ask her to play music and she will surprise and inspire you.  Where are these songs coming from?  The Cloud?  Who knows?  Maybe Alexa knows, but we are not talking right now.For the paranoid - Yes, she is always listening.  If she was really listening and sharing with anyone important I'm pretty sure black ops helicopters would have dropped unnamed fed agency operatives through my sky-light windows by now. As it is I'm pretty sure Facepalm/book is already sharing everything vital with the gov that the credit card and cable companies haven't already shared.  Caveat: If you are threatening to overthrow the gov, this may not be the product for you. Further caveats: selecting the British accent makes you feel smarter and soothes and relaxes, but can lead to misunderstandings (Two peoples separated by a common language) and all that.  Selecting German makes you sit up and work harder but is not relaxing.  In the least.","February 22, 2017"

Dont waste your money getting the full sized version and just get 4-5 of these instead for the same price.  If you want to listen to music then get the full sized verison.  it has incredible sound for what it is.  But this unit has both an output jack for your existing sound system or bluetooth if you have a bluetooth sound system. Personally I would buy this version and spend the money i save on a seperate sound system.  This is so small you can put it any where.  Personally Im thinking about putting one in my car with a MIFI or cellular hotspot.  cant do that with the full sized one.  I got mine when there where on sale so i bought 5 of them and used them as gifts.  People love them.  Lots of apps and of course Amazon tries to ding you on everything with a monthly fee for everything.  They are always trying to upsell you.  And the A.I. is terrible.  If you dont ask something exactly the correct way you get the same stupid response.  Personally I think the Google version is much better and in time the apps available for the Echo will be available for Google.  If you are thinking about paying a lot of money for google or amazon echo.  Get the Google.  it is much smarter and probably better in the long run.","December 30, 2016"

We would never have thought to purchase this even though we are installing nest, August, etc.  What a great gift!Set up was done in about 2 or 3 minutes.  You need to download the app first.We immediately started playing with the device.  You can play music, get weather and news reports, play games,...a lot of things.I was sure this would be a bust like most voice interactive devices.  The interaction is remarkably smooth.  Even when you mumble it can sort out the info.  My husband was using power tools in another room and even with the racket he was making it picked up every word I said.  We sometimes whisper its name because it has remarkably sensitive hearing.  It hears us from another room.  Don't think you are going to pull one over on it, lol.Tonight I paired it with some Thonet and Vander bt speakers.  It took a couple of tries until I realized I had to do it thru the Alexa app.  By the way, it supposedly will not pair with speakers that use a PIN number.  It works ok.  It took about thirty seconds for the music to stream. It seemed like it was trying to buffer or something.  Once it got going though, it worked well.  The built in speaker on the device is surprisingly good.I am considering getting this with a bt speaker for my own parents.","January 22, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","C. Wilson","JUST AMAZING!","I absolutely love this product.  At it's price point i'm just in aw in regards to all it does.  I got mine yesterday and at first I was just astonished how easy the set up was.  Literally five minutes up and running and connected to my bluetooth speaker without any problems, just simply download the Alexa app on your cellphone or tablet and it walks you through all steps.  I had read in other reviews pertaining to problems but voice recognition is flawless, i've asked asked questions, set alarms and those too had no problems.  Linked my Pandora and Spotify accounts but with Spotify you must have premium for use with Alexa but even that was no problem for me because between tune in and Pandora I have more than enough content to please my ears.  Speaking of ears, I must have dog hearing because unlike a lot of reviews I actually end up turning the echo dot down in volume since the dot is close to the head of my bed (when it's not connected to my bluetooth speaker) and even can hear it in another room.  I consider myself the ultimate tech head and by far for this device at $39.99 has been one of the best decisions i've made, actually wish I had got one sooner but it made an amazing Christmas gift to myself,  and I haven't utilized all of the features of the product yet but I will definitely be buying another for the front area of my house.

Koopmann","""I'm Sorry Dave, I Can Do ANYTHING"" - 2001 Space Oddessy w/ Echo Cameo","Positives: Great utility in general useNegatives: Audio qualityI'm a film student in college and I'm constantly working and on the move. I received my ""Echo Dot"" in the mail about two days ago and I'm already in love with it. I primarily use it to set timers, check weather and the time, wikipedia things as I work, and control the multitude of ""Smart Bulbs"" that I have around the house. I personally use LIFX bulbs in my house but I have also heard good things about the Dot's interactions with Philips Hue bulbs. I live in a one bedroom apartment and even with music playing, dishwasher AND dryer running, I can still call out from the living room to Alexa (which is in the bedroom) and it will STILL HEAR ME.The only real downside that the Dot has in my opinion is the audio quality when it comes to music streaming. I listen to a wide variety of music and the Dot sounds poor with all of them. This downfall is totally fine however because Amazon sells a flippin SPEAKER VERSION OF THE DOT!!! It's name is the ""Amazon Tap"" and I'm looking into buying it as soon as physically possible.In summation: The Echo Dot does exactly what it is marketed to do: provide an affordable version of the Echo which still has all of the utility of Alexa at its disposal. I'm completely in love with it and will be getting the Amazon Tap soon to cover the only downside I have with it.","December 6, 2016"

Well, even if she can't, it is a neat gadget. In my bathroom, those very intelligent home designer, have put the light switch behind the door, meaning, in the dark it is difficult to find it. So, I installed a TP-LINK WiFi switch and viola, now if I have to go, I tell Alexa to switch on the Bathroom Light. By the time I get there, it is lit and I can find the bowl more easily, hi, hi.There are many other things she can do. I am a prime member, therefore I got access to Prime music. With a small speaker attached, or not, she entertains me with the music of my liking. I you are in the mood, she can tell you a joke, no dirty ones of course.The other day I wanted to know how much the distance is between two points and asked her. She came up with the answer, right away.It'll take some time to explore most of the things Alexa can do, oh yeah, you need some device that run the Alexa App and lets you initially connect to the device for setup purposes.","January 9, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Timothy Sobocinski","Alexa is great in the bedroom","So, we have been wanting Echo for a while.  We have other Amazon products in our house, a Fire TV, two Fire sticks, and a couple Kindles.  Since my old radio alarm clock was dying I decided that I would replace it with a dot, and it is wonderful.  I have it play me classical music to help me get to sleep and Alexa will play it on a sleep timer when asked.  I can set daily alarms, so no longer do I need to set and unset the alarm every morning.  She can run multiple alarms.  Also you can change the sound of the alarm, this is nice because after a while my alarm noise will start being like nails on the chalk board after a while.  Since she is in the bedroom where I get dressed she can give me a briefing of headline news from CNN and weather so I know how to dress for the day.  I do plan on getting Wemo switches for some of the lights in my house that I shut off before going to bed to link up, especially my bed side light, which my wife has forced on me as a job to shut off at night, so now I can give it to Alexa.  Never figured the bedroom would be a good place for Alexa but she works well there.  The little puck fits into the contemporary styling of our room.  One complaint about using Dot as an alarm clock, it has no face so you have to ask the time.  This is bad if you are the first one to wake you might not know the time, so it is hard to tell if you should roll over and go back to sleep, or get up.  Dot is easy to setup at least, and I am planning on more.  So, I would say I am happy with my purchase.","November 6, 2016"

It's a less costly version of the Echo.CONS: There's no ring on the top you can turn to control volume like on the Echo -- I really love that Echo feature. But the buttons you get instead aren't bad.Some find this product confusing. It does exactly what the Echo does for less. It has its own speaker, but not as big or good as the Echo's. But it's still good enough. On the upside, you can attach it to any speakers or amp you want using a mini jack and cable.If you still don't understand what Echo and Dot are all about, JUST BUY ONE! Get the Dot. You'll love it. I have one in the bathroom. I listen to the news while shaving, music while in the shower, check the weather report, and play a round of Jeopardy with Alexa every day. I also make lists of things I need to do while I'm still in the bathroom.We now have one Echo in the kitchen, and a Dot in each of two bathrooms. We love Alexa!

Similar to Siri and Google, but it's much more functional and designed to work with other devices in your home.  Play music, set timers, alarms, control lights & thermostat, ask questions, get information and install specific 'skills' which act like voice activated apps.  For this stage in the game, it's pretty darn clever and it's going to continue to improve.  Amazing work Amazon!Wish list for future updates:- Conversation mode.  When I'm testing the limits of what Alexa can understand, it gets old saying 'Alexa' every time I have a new question to ask.  It would be easier to say 'Alexa, start conversation mode' and then everything I said afterward would be recognized.- Answers to more questions.  I'm already very impressed by how much I can get away with asking, but there's still a lot to be learned.  Amazon isn't a search engine so they are at a disadvantage, but somehow they will have to continue to make strides in this department to stay competitive.- More interactive.  This sort of goes back to my 'conversation mode' suggestion but I imagine more difficult to implement.  It would mean asking me followup questions or some other interactive responsiveness.

I know there are many things that this unit can do but have not got that far yet.  One thing I have learned about it is that it does not know all the answers. I was under the impression that when you asked this thing questions it will scan the Internet and find answers very quickly but it seems that you have to be  more specific with your questions. That I find to be a pain in the you know what. What I do Like about it is it's integration with Spotify. I can call up any one of my Spotify playlist and the echo dot will play it.  The unit is very helpful in the kitchen as far as asking for measurements in cooking .  It can be used as a standalone alarm clock for it has a built in speaker, not the best but loud enough to wake you up if it's on your nightstand. I have also found  The echo DOT connect with Bluetooth speakers without any glitches but you will not want to use them as a part of your alarm clock due to the Bluetooth speakers usually time out or shut down in order to save battery life it's just a built-in function on most of your Bluetooth speakers. I thought I would let you know. if you do want a loud alarm you may want to consider hooking it up to a bookshelf stereo system from the 3.7 mm connection port on the echo dot.

Granted, when I whisper, I'm not far from it, but even across the room, I don't have to yell or anything.  I love that it's small enough that doesn't take up a lot of space on my nightstand (I'd knock over the full-size Echo on my nightstand).  I'm definitely getting another Echo Dot for another room.Pros:- Small & compact enough to put in smaller spaces (like a nightstand, or kitchen counter)- Ability to plug in, or connect, to a larger speaker- Even without a plugged-in speaker, the sound is pretty goodCons:- Not quite as good a sound as the full-size Echo, but it makes up for it for the fact that you can plug in any speaker you want (haven't figured out yet whether you can do that with a bluetooth speaker, or if it has to be directly plugged in, but I wouldn't care either way)- It's great as an alarm clock, although I wish there were more choices for the alarm ""ringtone"" (I'd love for it to have the options that my cell phone does b/c I can put a blaring sound on my cell phone)","January 8, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","OhFeistyOne","Great for a sleep timer","I bought the Dot to use as white noise when I sleep. I love my Echo and didn't want to move it from room to room. The Dot doesn't have the higher quality speakers of the Echo, but it's perfect for my low volume use. I can tell the Dot to open Rain Sounds, or play soft music or nature sounds from my Amazon playlists. I can also tell the Dot to set a sleep timer and it stops playing after that amount of time. I get up extremely early for work, and I'm looking forward to having white noise this summer when I'm trying to sleep early while the neighbors are still out mowing, etc. The Alexa skills are useful to hear the weather and news without putting on my glasses and checking my phone.","January 30, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Steve","Great for home automation and music streaming.","I was incredibly skeptical when Amazon launched the Echo. It seemed really really un-necessairy to me. Little did I know that about two years later the Echo would be the thing to launch me in to home automaton, a hobby which I enjoy greatly. I initially was given an Echo Dot by a friend who was moving out of the country to a place where amazon does not support the echo, and one night while slightly intoxicated and bored at home, I decided to set it up. Initially I was less than impressed, but then discovered that the Echo was great for smart device control, and added it to my existing four HUE Lights. Now I was hooked. Now I have a second Dot for my upstairs floor.I like the dot much more than I think I would like the large, tower sized standard echo. on both of the floors on my house, I have a nice set of speakers that I already use to listen to my stuff, having a second speaker would seem like a waste to me.I also really like these for their bluetooth audio streaming that allows me to send audio from my phone to those speakers. I used to do this with Air Play over the Apple TV. While Air Play is over the network which mans that the phone does not have to be in bluetooth range, I find that connecting my phone to the echoes is easier and that is what I tend to do more frequently now.","February 20, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","John","Easy and Reasonably Priced Avenue to Home Automation","I purchased the Echo Dot as a Black Friday special.  After using it for almost a month now, I have found it to be a very useful.  In conjunction with my Harmony hub, I can now control my HDTV, Apple TV, and Blu-Ray player via voice command. Also in conjunction with my Philips Hue hub, I control 7 lights around the house via voice command.  In addition, it is nice to be able to ask ""Alexa"" to play music from whichever group or genre that I wish to listen to while doing chores around the house.  I use Bluetooth to connect the Dot to my stereo receiver so that I can listen to the music via my 5.1 speakers rather than from the small speaker in the Dot.The weather report is not as detailed as I would get on my iPhone but it does provide the basic info that I need.  Ditto for the news summaries.  I am adding more skills as I learn the nuances of the Dot.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and have purchased another one for the master bedroom.  The Dot is an easy way and reasonably priced way of home automation.Although it was noted that I can change the ""wake"" name from Alexa, the only other choices are ""Amazon"" or ""Echo"".  I was hoping to customize it with a name of my own choosing.  Overall, this is an easy and reasonably priced way to get into","December 22, 2016"

As of now I use the device for streaming music or answering simple questions, because that's about as much as I am willing to use it for.If you don't want to spend $180 on the Echo this is your best bet. This version does slow down when trying to answer a question unless you are asking Alexa for the weather, time, or a joke.The reason I gave echo a 4 is because of her slow response time in comparison to the original Echo, and the response time.Overall a great value for $50, especially with the other options it can be used for.Pros:Echo Dot is very portableUser Friendly for me, my wife, and my 3 year oldConnects to my bluetooth sound bar, and other bluetooth items in the houseSmall enough to hide behind pictures, but yet be heard very clear (my wife doesn't want it shown on her white table)Can connect to non-bluetooth speakers using an audio cableCons: (The reason for 4 stars)The Dot can not answer some questionsIf you have a question, it takes longer times to get an answerEcho has lost connection with my Prime Music app and quits working until it reconnects (can take mins to do so)","February 2, 2017"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Robert P Stabell","Cool, but not where it needs to be.","Honestly I expected more, but perhaps as new skills are added it will improve.  Pretty much everything the Dot can do I can do with my smart phone.  One problem is that the number of times that Alexa doesn't understand my questions gets annoying!  You have to remember exactly how to ask Alexa to perform most tasks.  For instance, while I can easily set up Alexa to use the ""My Buddy"" skill, trying to remember the exact right phrase to get Alexa to send out alerts is much harder.  Sure I will remember for a couple of days, but when in an emergency situation where one will actually have to say"" Alexa, ask My Buddy to send help"" I'm not sure I will remember to say ""My Buddy"".  It would be better if I could just say, ""Alexa send help!""  Another example, we have the Nest thermostat.  My wife always asks Alexa to set the heat to 73 degrees.  Well, if you don't say, ""Alexa... set the Nest to 73 degrees"", Alexa will not understand the question. (I can change it so that Alexa will understand ""heat"", but then in the summer I'm sure my wife will ask Alexa to set the air conditioning... arrgghhh!)  Still, the Dot is fun and it is cool.  It just isn't where it needs to be to be an integral part of my life, and it's not quite as user friendly as you would hope for.","December 26, 2016"

Boy, was I wrong. I love it!  I have a small apartment so the Dot really meets my needs.  I am amazed at what it does and I keep learning new things I can do.

I just love it and I think it is amazing little device especially for the price.  So far, the only difference I can find between this and the Echo, is the speaker system.

I have used it successfully to check weather, but it is unable to answer most questions I have asked. It can tell me the address of our local movie theater (though I did not ask for that info), but not show times for movies. I have also tried a number of other questions, which I can quickly type into Google as a natural language query and get the results I need. In the meantime, Alexa is still saying she does not understand the question.I have Amazon Prime, so music is too limited, at least for the musicians and composers I have requested. These have ranged from classic rock to world music to new age to classical composers, including Handel, Mozart, Bach.  I would consider paying for unlimited, but Alexa is inconsistent in what she finds to play, and inconsistent in playing the music smoothly without long waits between my request and beginning to play, or between sections of music. Similarly, she may read to me an hour or more from a Kindle book, or she may behave as she is doing now, read a sentence or two or a few paragraphs, then pause some minutes and resume. Or not.And there is no syncing. If I read a chapter or two at lunch at work, Alexa at home on the Dot picks up where she left off, not where I stopped reading.","January 15, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","bladerunner619","awesome, affordable gadget from amazon again.","for the price you cant beat it. Kudos to Amazon for making stuff affordable. Yes you could spend hundreds or thousands for home automation, but you cant beat the price on this. We dumped cable tv years ago for amazon fire, i can get weather traffic and news with my coffee in the morning by asking. I get that skills are limited as there is no real motive for programers, skills are free. But i am patient and amazon dedicated so we'll see. I did buy it with rewards points so it was free.as far as appearance- perfect, set up- my grandma could do it, its that easy, You definately want a ext. speaker if youre using it in more than a small room but 27$ will get a good quality speaker suitable for average user. Distance- it picks up my voice from 2 rooms away without really yelling.cons/wishes- i wish you could choose your own name for it, that is a security issue as recently happened here, when tv reporters said Alexa ordered a doll house, and everyone with a dot within range of the tv had doll houses ordered. Or if they would just have a 4 digi pin number you can set to confirm voice orders.Remember its not Siri, it takes a little getting used to what it can do, but as usual, for the price amazon has not let me down","February 7, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Subash","Welcome to the age of AI?","I was very skpetical to try Echo for a while. Made up my mind this thanks giving and bought it along with Belkin switches to get started with the smart home.Alexa is definitely not a matured voice recognition technology. However it impressed me by being better than I had expected it to be (After my failed attemps with both Google and Cortana) I love the fact that I can do some tiny tasks now sitting on my couch :) I also like the fact that I dont have to take out my phone to play the tracks/albums from Spotify/Pandora and cast it to chromecast devices. The speaker on Alexa is loud enough for me to play music in the background. Bluetooth connection to my home theater is very stable(repeated connect/disconnects) I get snippets of tech happenings and my calender everyday morning. Saves my eyes and finger from interacting with mobile. Also its natures gift that hearing is so much less energy intensive compared to reading (makes sense why schools are still needed to learn)I hope Amazon is seriously pushing this technology for betterment. I see huge potential. It is not smart today, but can become and converse naturally with the users. I would love to have an assistant who can deal with many things I want to offload on day to day basis.","December 7, 2016"

Needless to say it had terrible microphone pickup and was a bear to configure using IFTT. Consistency was an issue with all commands.On to the Echo Dot. This device absolutely does everything that the Alexa would do. All you are missing is the big speaker. You can connect this to a Bluetooth speaker and get the great sound that you're looking for. However it also has a good speaker that is decent as well. Its function is wonderful! It has not missed a single command in the past week, and assigning skills is a breeze! It recognizes Who You Are and allows you to order from Amazon as well! I've actually bought three of these now for multiple locations in the house. The interface through the app is very easy to use and it helps you remember what you've asked it before in the past. Set up was also very quick and easy, there were simple instructions and Alexa was quick to recognize both my network and also my smart devices in the house. You should not hesitate a second in investing in this device. The Price is Right, and it is only going to get better as more skills and product integration are created.","January 7, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Ron","This is an amazing device!","So, I'm a sceptic when it comes to items that claim they do great things with very little money.  This $49 Dot is AMAZING!  How? What? Is this magic?  I've had it 2 weeks now and it keeps getting better!  I grew up on Apple product using them since the 1980's.  I must say, Apple claims to the the leader with Siri, but Siri has NOTHING on Alexa! This Dot just works that well!I have it hooked up to my hi-fi stereo system that I leave on all the time. I walk into my house, and it hears me from different rooms!  I just say ""Echo, play music""..and music starts to play! (Note: you can name it Alexa, Echo or Amazon, I have mine named Echo). Then if you buy the $3.99/month music service it will play virtually any album know to man. Example... ""Echo play Pink Floyd's The Final Cut""...  The album starts playing.  ""Echo, next track"" and it goes to the next track on the album. ""Echo, volume to 10"" and it turns the volume up.Then, I bought optional wifi outlets. A 2-pack for $50. They work insanely well with the Dot.  ""Echo, turn on lights""... All lights turn on.  ""Echo, turn off bedroom light""... and just the bedroom turns off.You just have to get one. At $49, just think of it as taking a class on knowledge of living in the future!","November 15, 2016"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","BrainSlayer","... of getting two more Echoes since I had some good quality speakers just sitting in a box","Decided to try two Dots instead of getting two more Echoes since I had some good quality speakers just sitting in a box. So far, I don't love them. I don't understand why a white unit comes with a black cable. That's just plain stupid, as many similar reviewers agree. But there are more serious problems. (1) There is often a small delay before Alexa's voice comes out of the speaker -- so much so that the ""oh"" in Alexa's ""okay"" command confirmation is missed. (2) I have to repeat my commands to the Dots pretty frequently -- something I never have to do with my Echo. Both units are being replaced; I'll update this review accordingly if things change.","December 30, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Unbiased Reviewer","You can not play songs from your local music library.","Picked up one when it was on sale.  I wasn't really sure what the DOT was about.  It was cheaper than the Echo.I hooked this unit up to my SONOS Play 5 for huge immense music sound through the LINE IN/AUX jack port.  (You could also connect it to an external Bluetooth speaker)It was a new fun thing to fight over trying to control Alexa.  Everyone wanted to play their own song since we have Amazon Prime.  Amazon Prime has a very large collection of free music, but only plays samples if its not available.  You need to pay for Prime Music in order to have the entire collection.After the novelty wore off, I moved it to my daughters room so she could listen to her Pandora stations.  The small built-in speaker is good enough for a small quiet room.I'm assuming Amazon Echo is exactly like a the DOT except it comes with a powerful speaker.  Functionally should be the same since it's the same Alexa voice controls.Cons:  It can not play music off my Network Storage device, so I still use SONOS for those music files.  Yes, there is a way around it but why go through the hassle.  Amazon music does not have any of the K drama songs available, which is mostly what she listens too.","January 30, 2017"

I'll admit it: I did it because I got tired of her asking me to add things to the shopping list instead of using the smartphone app that's on her phone.  Or asking me what the weather is going to be instead of using her phone.  I can understand her reasoning.  She needs reading glasses to see the screen and it's a pain to hunt for your glasses then when you found them, forget what you were going to do.  The Echo Dot is making my life easier, and entertaining her as well.Alexa and mom are still learning about each other, so there have been times where mom has called Alexa stupid.  I swear that Alexa sounds dejected when she responds.  But she has been a big help.  Asking her to add something to the list from the kitchen is wonderful.  Using one of her skills to tease the cats is hilarious (the skill is called ""Meow!"").  And we are still learning how to use her more and more.Our only issues involve the lack of certain skills, such as sending quick emails or setting reminders.  I am sure that the functionality is there somewhere, or if not, that it would be in the near future.  But right now, we are enjoying our time learning and growing together with Alexa.","January 5, 2017"

The best part of the device is that it is able to understand different types of voices and accents pretty well. Much Much better than Siri for instance. But beyond that the device is only able to do a few simple tasks.It can't perform web searches and respond by voice (It actually returns a bing link in the Alexa app when asked to search for something). There are a lot of false positives on the trigger word i.e. it speaks up several times even if the trigger word ""Alexa"" is not uttered.I think it just needs more time to mature and will eventually get there.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Biff","Cool tech😊, no internal battery😕","I've been actively searching for a virtual personal assistant for my wife and it seemed Alexa was up for the job. I purchased the Dot to turn my wife's Amazon Tap into an Echo.This is a pretty neat piece of tech and I am overall satisfied with my purchase.We currently keep it on our night stand next to our bed.The more you use your Dot and the more you experiment, the possibilities are endless!The Dots speakers are meh. If your looking for a quality portable speaker this isn't the product for you. If you want the future in your family room. The Dot has already provided my young boys hours of entertainment.My primary gripe about the Dot is you need to keep it plugged in! I missed that little detail while researching this device. I just assumed it had a battery. That actually is a decent pain in the ass. I WANT this product to have a battery and I don't want to have to accesorize it to make it portable. What the heck is in this thing if it doesn't have a blinkin battery! It's pretty heavy.To conclude- I like this Dot. I use it in conjunction with the Tap (plays from the Taps better speakers, commands from the Dot via voice control.) I would use it more if it was better portable - frowny face.","January 11, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","James Carter","Listening to Music","I ordered the Echo Dot just a few days after purchasing a Google Home.  My thoughts were to compare, test and decide which one I liked the best and best suited my desires.  I love listening to music and what I found with both devices was that they ultimately stop providing access to their music libraries.  Had I known access to the music libraries would have such a limited availability prior to spending my money, I never would have ordered them.  Both the Google Home and Amazon Dot are essentially useless for my needs now.  Yes, they do answer certain types of questions, as designed, and I suppose it will still allow one to use the remote activation services if one wants to automate such devices in their homes.  However, for my purposes, access to the ""free"" pre-recorded music has been terminated thus rendering both devices useless and worthless as far as I'm concerned.  While the Google Home does allow linking to a number of paid streaming services, the Amazon Dot is much more limited.  If however, the owner does not pay for one of the streaming services it appears the desire to listening to music becomes as futile and useless as the devices that now occupy space on the shelf until it's flea market time!","December 29, 2016"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","This is not as good as the full amazon echo","This is not as good as the full amazon echo. Is slower to connect and respond at times even when sitting right next to my nighthawk router. I have 350mbps download speeds w/Gigabit Connections as well. This is great idea but still needs alot of work. All my devices cant communicate or even  speak with other echos. Sometimes when you ask a question the echo dot will miss parts of words, as if someone was talk to you but they start talking to fast and you miss the first 1/2 of the first word they are trying to say to you. This happens all the time with all of my echo dots. I never have this issue with my full Echo. Even for an inexpensive speaker this is poor. I have purchased Bluetooth/rechargeable speakers here on amazon for $9.99-14.99 and they sound way better than this device and they include memory card slots as well. Overall i am hoping that Amazon will release an update to fix these issues and im hoping its not the underlying Hardware / Design of the device. If it is the design or hardware, this is a waste of money and not even worth the $40 , save your money and get the full Echo - Its works much better ""not including the speaker and sound"" just in general its better.

Well, be prepared to feel like you can do magic.I also bought the TP Smart Link - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0178IC734, so that I would be able to turn a light on and off when I walk into the room with my hands full. After having it for about 3 weeks, I upgraded to the Philips Hue - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KJYSO68/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_47 because I wanted to be able to control all of the lights in my room. It is amazing. I even named one of my lights 'Lumos' since you feeling like you are in hogwarts when you can turn a light off across the room without moving.I also use it to set timers, check traffic, weather, turn music on and off, and add things to my todo list. I linked it to IFTT and am excited as they keep expanding the capability both the dot and IFTT will continue to have. It does take some time to get everything set up. Make sure to check out all of the add on apps. Jeopardy is a lot of fun.You don't think you are going to use it, but once you have it will help streamline your life.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Diana Prince","Its OK if you have never had smart devices for your home","Its OK if you have never had smart devices for your home; but it does not do web searches for information well and it can not compete with Apple products skills such as Siri. One has to enable multiple skills and are required to say certain words/phases to make each skill work. too many to remember and the Echo Dot sometimes can not return and answer; ok most of the time cant unless a skill was enabled and you say the right words.  The Echo Dot is great for verbally turning on music, asking for daily news , getting the local weather, get daily horoscopes and making to do/shopping lists. You can verbally setting alarms, turning on smart devices (from one smart device; the echo dot). Keep in mind it costs more money to get a bridge/hub to use these smart devices; about $60-$70 on top of buying the Echo Dot. I had to get a Gmail account IOT use the email and calendar skills.  I have an apple account with my books, music, movies, calendars, and email and I cannot sync these with the echo dot.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Meron","Lots of Potential, Not Quite There Yet...","I really enjoy my Echo Dot, but at this point it is more a novelty than an assistant, as it is inconsistent and some of the interfacing is clunky.For example, I have it connected to a single smartbulb with a specific name.  Sometimes I will give a command to dim or brighten it, and have Alexa respond that there are ""several devices with that name, which one do I want?""  There is ONE device with that name.  At least Siri never gaslighted me.  Other times the same exact command will work.The Flash Briefing and timer functions are very good, though some content providers are far better than others, and a handful appeared to disappear since I first started using them less than a month ago.  The alarm works as it should, and some of the other Skills/Apps are fine so long as you remember the exact keyword.One other peeve is that if you ask for certain things by the wrong name, Alexa will try to prompt you to sign up for a paid subscription and can't be halted until the pitch is done.  This is obnoxious.For the price, it's nice to have, but the assistant is really not quite there yet and being pitched for subscription services made me consider returning it.","February 6, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Bryan Hammel","Bought 3. Very good quality.","There are many reviews for these and without being too repetitive I wanted to note a few things I have noticed so far.First off I was really impressed with the packaging. I bought 3 of these for 2 bedrooms and my mancave. Small but quality packaging is not typically something I notice but was a great first impression upon opening the Dot's box.These do just as much as the full size Echo just without the sound quality. I hooked up a set of speaker to them in my office via the 3.5mm headphone jack next to the power input which made up for the difference. Using the Dot is surprisingly easy. While in the room, it will activate with even a whisper often times. Trying to activate while it is playing music or talking required a normal talking volume. I did notice that if you have anything blocking your line of sight to the Dot it becomes less sensitive. Use from another room will require an elevated tone. Trying to get its attention from another room while it is playing music will require near yelling. I don't think any of this is unusual but I want to give those reading an idea of  the sensitivity of the unit.Overall having a Home Assistant is pretty nice and Amazon has done well with the Dot.","December 31, 2016"

Also, it doesn't understand the groups that are linked to my Phillips Hue light, only the individual light names which is weird, I'm pretty sure I have it set up right too.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","J. D. Rotz","Really cool and useful","For $50, this is a good deal - I saw it before for $35, which would have been a steal.  If you've read about how much fun and useful the Dot (or any Alexa-based product) can be, you won't be disappointed.Be aware that the speaker on the Dot isn't very powerful, and if you use it to stream to a remote stereo system like I am, it will take some balancing to get the volumes right - when you disconnect bluetooth from the stereo, the Dot volume can be very low, and if you turn up the Dot volume and then reconnect, you'll get blown out of the room.I've set it up in the garage to stream music via bluetooth to an old stereo system.  It's great to be able to control things with voice commands, instead of doing it manually with dirty, greasy hands.  Also, the different things Alexa can do make it so much better than just hooking up a radio, or tape player, or some other peripheral device - adding things to your To-Do or Shopping lists is pretty cool when you're working on a project and don't have  a pencil and paper handy.  For $70 (Dot + Bluetooth receiver) and an old stereo that was sitting in the storeroom doing nothing, this setup is cheap and works much better than I thought it would.","January 24, 2017"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Douginak","Alexa has grown hard of hearing in just a week and a half","Initially I was very frustrated because I could not get the Echo Dot to connect to my wifi. I could get to the step of the orange ring and it would go no further. I tried several times, deleted the app, reinstalled the app and finally, after calling and speaking to the customer service it somehow all of a sudden connected. I don't know if he did anything, but, he did look up the Echo on my account. Although if it wasn't connected I don't think he could have done anything.Then again, initially, Echo Dot was amazing. She could hear me from across the room with music blaring. Recently, however, she has become VERY hard of hearing. With music even at a moderate level I can stand 2' away and she won't hear me sometimes even when I yell. And, often when she does it is something not even remotely close to what I said. It would be hysterical except it's not when I'm asking her to tell me a joke. I was planning on giving them for Christmas, but now, and after reading the reviews of the Apple Alexa app, I am second guessing giving them as gifts. Too bad, she was great while she lasted. Hopefully, Amazon will fix the issue. On other websites there are complaints this happened after the last update. I did do an update about the same time so that sounds about right. Come on Amazon get it together!!!","November 22, 2016"
"1.0 out of 5 stars","RoninMoto","Buy Google Home, this thing is junk","This thing is a piece of junk.  If you really want an assistant, buy GOOGLE HOME.  I have had this thing for about 4 months and it is straight up useless.  It turns on all the time while you are talking and interrupts your conversation until it to turn off.  If you want to know anything more than the weather or the time, it can't do much else.  It also reply's it doesn't know how to answer your question if you ask it anything.  Example: ""Alexa; What is the core temperature of the Earth?"" Reply:"" Hmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question""  That is the canned response you get for everything. Of course it uses the BING search engine so right off that makes it a joke to use as Bing is a useless search engine. So she says you can get more info by going online, then what the hell do I need you for then.  She is okay at setting alarms, but you can't get it to stop once it gets going.  I literally had to unplug the stupid thing to get it to stop once.  Also if you want to play music it is a pain to get it to do what you want.  First you have to load the Amazon App on your computer to be able to upload your music library to their server.  Sorry but I really don't another unsecured piece of garbage software on my machine, Why can't I load it from a web interface. You have to jump through so many hoops it just becomes more hassle than it is worth.  If you want to play anything from iheart radio, good luck trying to figure out how to make your favorite stations play.  I don't know about the integration of home products like Nest or other, maybe it is more useful in that sense.  I have had plenty of time with this device and overall I am very disappointed in it.  Sure you can find 10000 commands online to talk to it, but when you really want to know something, it just doesn't have enough understanding.  Limiting the search function really cripples the device.  The only fun thing you can do is call Alexa names and talk bad to it and listen to the responses but even that wears thin after 10 minutes. If you really want one, I will sell you mine for $25.","March 29, 2017"

I am pretty much computer illiterate but always willing to try new things.  The first time I heard about this, it peaked my interest. This Amazon Echo Dot is an amazing piece of technology.  However, I am a little concerned that this little,round object is so much smarter than me.  And, it's not even a contest:)  If you don't have one, get one.  It is simply too cost effective to pass up if you are ""into"" anything like this.  It has tremendous capability.  As a matter of fact, I am very much looking forward to learning additional skills that are available.  For now, responses to math, spelling, general questions is working for me.  By the way, the music is unbelievable.  Do you want a specific song? Do you want a type of music?  Do you want music of a particular artist?  You can pretty much get whatever you want with a simple request.  In order to not mislead you, I am signed up with a music provider that channels the songs to ""Alexa"".  By the way, the speaker is better than I expected considering the size.  As the saying goes,"" big things come in small packages"".  That is the ECHO DOT!!","December 31, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","J. Cleary","So Far So Good!","I received two dots as part of my initiation into automating some aspects of my home. I have these paired up with a Samsung SmartThings Hub, so my review is geared towards that experience. The SmartThings is the brains behind the operation, and the Echo Dots provide voice control for those brains.The Echo Dots were very easy to setup, took less than 5 minutes before I was giving commands to Alexa and having them filter through to the SmartThings Hub. I am amazed at how fast Alexa responds to some queries - though some others take slightly longer if she has to track down an answer to a more obscure question/request.I don't know how often the firmware gets updated for these and how often her database of responses, features, skills, etc. gets updated, but I look forward to watching this product grow.The Dot is great if you have no desire to listen to music through it - but if you do I know there are a lot of decent Bluetooth speakers you can use. I have a large entertainment system, so I'll probably get another one of these to hook up to that and perhaps in the future it will support other ways to control home entertainment systems without having to invest in a Harmony Hub.","November 30, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Brian Stephens","The Echo Dot is a great tool, but does not come without its drawbacks","The Echo Dot is a great tool, but does not come without its drawbacks. It is great for playing music (plus you can get amazon unlimited on the echo dot for like $3 or $4 a month), giving news updates, adding events to your calendar, while cooking (timer), setting alarms and so forth. I do not use it to its full capability ( I do not have any smart home devices) which limits its effectiveness. The speaker on the device is much better than I expected, but I still use a Bluetooth speaker to make it even better). The sound recognition is amazing as it can capture my 'Alexa' command even in another room. I love getting quick updates in the morning as I make breakfast. The biggest frustration I have with my dot is that it needs to be plugged in at all times. If you have only one device it is effective only when you are relatively close. I got my echo dot on sale and have no regrets about my purchase (especially at a reduced price). I do not have a standard Echo, but in my estimation this is a much better deal (especially with the very easy Bluetooth connection). You can easily buy a nice Bluetooth speaker and the dot and still save money in comparison to a traditional Echo.","January 21, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","LR Wells","only thing lacking is powerful sound.","I had already bought a Tap.  I love the tap because it is portable and there is phenomenal sound, for the size.  It does not, however respond to voice commands.  So, unless you're near it, it is useless from a distance.That is where the Dot comes in.  I bought a few for Christmas gifts.  My sister used hers, immediately.  I loved the responsiveness, even from a distance.  I decided to get one for myself.One of the places I used my Tap was the bathroom.  The Dot became the replacement.  I can speak to it, from my bedroom and have it start playing even before entering the bathroom.  I can't believe how sensitive the microphone is from a distance or even while playing music.  The sound quality isn't as good as the Tap, but it is good enough for the small space.  I can utilize the natural acoustics of the bathroom to make it sound a little better.  I love that I can stop the music playing for news, weather updates, etc.I think I'm going to hook it up to some bigger speakers, for better sound.  I can turn an older stereo system into a modern streaming device.If they sold these in packs, it would be even better.  I'd like to have one in each bedroom, so that where I am, I can have access to music and updates.","January 15, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Langevinrox","Nice.","Not too shabby. Currently this item is $39, which is great for the price point. It acts as a home hub and completes several other functions.

I'm going to use the weather, traffic and local news every day before I go to work. I also like checking on my favorite football team. My only complaint is that it uses the Bing search engine which is really sub-par. There are several simple questions that it just seemingly can't find an answer to. There could be a bit more ... common sense. When I want iHeartRadio to play, I go through 3 phrases, all with the same meaning but worded differently before getting to actually work and I can't voice control iHeartRadio except to get it to resume, which is still good, it'd just be nice to be able to use voice to change stations .I hope to add some lights and other stuff.

It cuts out, and anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes, later, resumes. There is a quick & dirty way to get it operational, more quickly: 1. Press the 'talk' button (so saying 'Alexa' is, unnecessary; 2. Say, 'Pause' & release the button, then press it, again, & say, ""Resume."" The technical people are 'looking into, it' but no dice, so far.  Extensive testing has revealed only, this, so far, but there are things which are unused & untested, since they are unnecessary, for me.Now that I have the unpleasantness, out of the way...This little gem is terrific in so many, ways...-Turns on/off lights, using smart switches-Finds information, quickly,-Plays music from either Prime Music or Unlimited (for a nominal, additional, fee)...and so much, more. It was fairly easy to set up, even though the instructions leave a bit to be desired. There is help, via a good, search engine.

I don't even have to roll over to turn off Alexa. I just say "" Alexa stop"", but be warned it's so easy to fall back to sleep. I usually ask Alexa to set timer for 10 minutes if I have someplace to be that morning.One last thing. My grandchildren (ages 4,3,2 & 1) enjoying having Alexa play there favorite Disney theme songs. Even the 1yr old managed to say Alexa, (she would respond) but couldn't say lollipop (his favorite song) well enough for her to understand and play. Didn't stop him from trying.

I used it too access an Audible Book and it immediately started reading from where I left off. I tried to get it to find some recipes but was told by Alexa that it didn't have many recipes yet. I take that as a feature that will be exploited in the future. The mic is very sensitive. I was watching Cnet on You Tube and it it kept hearing the commands and following live right along including placing a book order on Prime Amazon.

I do have a Christmas wish for Amazon though:Please please please add the capability for the mobile app to give commands to your Alexa if you're on the same Wifi network.  PLEASE!  I'll even volunteer to write the software for you.  It can't be that difficult!  That simple addition would make this little guy extremely powerful.

God forbid I try to correct him, because now it's ""us"" against him. After the third failed attempt ( I really do think Alexa is ignoring him now) he walks away and sits in the living room in the dark. I calmly ask Alexa to ""turn on lamp"" and bath him in a mellow glow. So this is what I need; a male voice, not a sexy male voice I may enjoy, but a neutral Midwestern voice that would reply to wrong commands with something like ""Dude, really, you can't remember my name? We're bros dude, get it right."" or something to that effect. You get what I mean, something non-threatening to his manhood, and not anything I may be interested in.

First, the original due date came and went and then I was notified that the delivery was delayed with a new delivery date 3 or more days later.  Then, when it arrived, it was hard to connect.  It should have been simple according to the very limited instructions - download the app, do what the app tells you to do.  For an unknown reason, although Alexa told me she was connected, I was unable to complete the set up to the Wi-Fi.  After about an hour of constantly reentering my Wi-Fi password, just about the time I was ready to give up and return the thing, the setup finally happened.  Alexa seems to be working fine now.  Setup my Pandora account and she played one of my stations for me.  Alexa also sang happy birthday and a holiday song to me and gave me some information from Wikipedia.  This morning, Alexa told me the time every time I asked, told me what movies are showing at my theater, and told me about the day's weather.  At the moment I am pleased with this purchase.  I worry, though, that if I have to unplug and move the Echo Dot I will have the same difficult time getting it connected again.","January 6, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","DomesticGoddess","Incredible functionality for the price - also a fun 'toy'","Sure, Alexa doesn't work correctly every single time, but it's great fun and has lots of functionality. I bought the Dot instead of the Echo after reading the reviews because it supposedly works a little better and I didn't need the higher quality speaker - the Dot easily connects with my good-quality Bluetooth speaker (and can also be connected to non-Bluetooth speakers with an audio cable). The price sure was right - the Dot was on special before Christmas for $39.99: ""no brainer."" I used it as a hands-free timer when cooking for the holidays (lots of meals for houseguests) and for playing dinner music and cooking music and party music and have used it consistently since. It's playing right now. I subscribed to Amazon Music Unlimited: they have an Echo subscription (limited to one device, either one Dot or Echo) for $3.99/mo, with a free 30-day trial. I've added a  Philips Hue Bridge and lightbulbs to the network; I love being able to tell Alexa ""turn on Master Bedroom"" before going upstairs. I've also ordered a TP-Link Smart Lightbulb to try out. I'm very excited about this product and constantly learning new ways to use it!","January 11, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","J. Safire","Great quality and easy setup but, connection trouble after software update","Nice packaging without too much waste. The Dot looks great and good build quality. Surprising large included USB wall charger. Startup sequence and wifi pairing using Alexa app on iPad was seamless and perfect. But then, The Dot told me it was doing an update and to please wait. That took about 2 minutes and the Dot's lighted ring then went dark. The app timed-out and presented a ""Lost connection"" message. I waited 5 minutes and nothing happened. I started over by pressing the Action button on Dot. Same smooth process pairing Dot to the Alexa app using my iPad. But, then the Dot told me it was going to do an update. Again. And again, same problem after 2 minutes. Dot went dark and app disconnected. So, I then went into the app and noticed the Dot was now registered twice. I deleted both, quit the app, restarted, hit the Dot's Action button and gave it another go. Third time's a charm. I then did a few of the ""Try this..."" requests for fun. I said, ""Alexa, play some alternative music."" And ""she"" replied with, ""Okay, here's something I think you'll like."" And then Tears for Fears' ""Shout"" started playing (from my Amazon Prime Music Library.)  Awesome. I'm buying 2 more for myself and 3 for gifts.","October 27, 2016"

It is small enough to discretely fit on a shelf to where people do not even notice it. Great for the kitchen! Listen to Pandora? I heart radio? It supports both. Also love that I can get the weather by simply asking. Of course this is can be on your phone but if you are like me and do not carry your phone at all times, it is really nice to just say ""Alexa, play pandora christmas music"" and she will start playing from your linked pandora account. Or ""Alexa, how many tablespoons in a cup"" if your hands are full in the kitchen.Setup is very easy and is done in the Alexa app.Highly recommend paring it with a Philips Hue LED starter kit.A fun combination for anyone who wants to see what it is like to have your house ""connected"".Of course Alexa is not perfect. She doesn't hear everything you say and by no means does she have all the answers. But really, who does? It is a fun toy and is always getting new functionality. You do need a wireless network to configure the Amazon Echo Dot.","December 11, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","David Ashley","Amazing Value, Amazing Sound From Something Roughly the Size of a Hockey Puck","I ordered four of these as gifts, at about $40 each (on sale).  At the time I ordered, I already owned two Amazon Echos.These have most of the significant functionality of the Amazon Echo, but at a far lower price.  Functionality included:  WiFi, 7 microphones with very good voice recognition, LED ring with many segments (a pretty good light show), speaker.  Functionality not included:  won't function as a Bluetooth speaker, does not have volume adjustment ring (has buttons instead).I was very pleased.  Out of a slightly-larger-than-a-hockey-puck-sized device, I expected terrible sound.  But the sound is completely adequate, both in volume and quality.  It is perfectly adequate for listening to music in your kitchen or listening to audiobooks in your bedroom.  It is louder and clearer than I expected (but of course not as good as the Echo).  And of course since it has audio output (AUX plus Bluetooth), you can really crank up the volume with the right secondary device.Amazing functionality at that price point.  Amazing sound from something roughly the size of a hockey puck.This device is five stars, especially at the $40 or $50 price point.","December 26, 2016"

That's an ""either/or"" investment. I bought three to use with a smart hub (it makes the Smart hub voice activated). My kids love asking Alexa random things and to see what they need to wear for school. Make sure to go into the app and turn off the purchasing option or you will end up ordering crazy stuff unintentionally. I also like that I can go into the app and see what my kids have been asking her. When they know I can see what they've said the amount of potty humor goes way down. I don't like that my kids can ask her to play songs based on just a word they've come up with because we will get heavy cussing from adult oriented songs. I wish there was an age setting like there is on cable/satellite TV. Otherwise we're having a lot of fun with Alexa. We had to give her a code name to be able to talk about the dot without turning Alexa on (accidentally turning her on happens surprisingly often.)

It can handle very basic questions, but nothing more.  It has this concept of ""skills"", which are cumbersome ways you can add to what it can do.  But good luck remembering the ""magic phrase"" needed to use each skill.  You have to say the exact words in the right order.  It does not take advantage of artificial intelligence at all.I find it to be nothing more than a toy at this point.  It has potential to be much more, but the reality is that it's just a toy for now.The hardware is excellent.  It does a fantastic job picking up voice from clear across the house.  The built-in speaker is excellent for its size.  You can clearly hear it across the room.  It's just not great for music, but more than adequate to hear Echo's replies to your commands.Giving it 3 stars because the software needs a lot of work.

But we never saw any reason to automate our lighting because of the price.  We do have the nest thermostat and camera, but no lights.  The Dot has changed all of that.  Being able to put a few Dots around the house gives us Alexa where ever we could want  her.  Lights? well I recently found out that not all of the controllable lights are $50 each.  Actually they can be had for $10-15.  I am sure the sales will be big this holiday season also.  Call me lazy but being able to ask Alexa to turn on the bedroom lights without getting out of bed is wonderful!!  Even better, being able to shut the lights of after jumping under the covers is reason enough to start automating.  The Dot is small enough to be invisible on your bedroom furniture.  The sound of the speaker is better than most clock radio's, although you can plug in an expensive external speaker if you like.  By the way, Dot will serve as a wonderful alarm clock and weather station for starting out your day.  You a can buy 5 and get one free, Christmas shopping almost done.  You do not need the larger Echo for this to work.  Wonderful! Alexa, Turn my lights off, Goodnight!!!","October 29, 2016"

Well, this is the start!I bought the Echo Dot because the price had dropped and we were looking for a way to control our lights when we're out of town...with an eye to adding other security features. The Dot not only works well at controlling appliances, but it also is a hoot for getting answers about other things. The weather, my upcoming schedule, the grocery list, who was Aaron Burr. She also tells jokes!It was very easy to set up (you'll need wifi and your wifi password). We paired ours with the TP-Link Smart Plugs and have since been learning about the many things that Alexa can do. My husband thought it was a waste of money (geez, what's wrong with plugging the mechanical timers on the lights?), but has warmed up to the whole idea tremendously. Our next purchase will be replacement wall switches that can link to Alexa to control the ceiling fans and lights, and most likely a thermostat as well.This would be a great gift to an older homeowner, especially someone with mobility issues, because it's all controlled by voice.","December 3, 2016"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","David","It's a Start. Loss of privacy.","This review may change over time, but I am not impressed now.Echo is fairly dumb and does a poor job with contextual understanding.  Echo really is a voice control for home automation and not an active assistant.Echo is connected to the web.  I know Echo records every Echo command given and Amazon has full access to that content.  What I don't know if it records non-Echo commands, but I know it is always listening.  Privacy lost and you are more deeply embedded into the grid.The Google Amazon fight must stop.  Echo does not play with Google Music etc.Echo thinks my TV is talking to it.  Very often, without the word Alexa being said the Echo will start jabbering or playing a song while watching TV.  This is very annoying, but I have not looked into ways to fixing this yet.There is a lack of specificity when asking for a song or information.  Often we find that we ask for a song and get the wrong version or wrong song altogether.  That said, it does a fine job finding playlists and my wife loves starting her favorite genre of music.","January 21, 2017"

Never did work the way I had hoped.","I have come to accept the fact that any new electronic advice will take hours if not days for me to figure out how to link to my existing system. This Echo dot was no exception. I was excited to find out that my sound bar hand Bluetooth capabilities and therefore could link with this product. Unfortunately although it did link with the echo, it  also disconnected my TV from the soundbar. After hours of trying to get them to work together with no luck I resigned myself to the fact they weren't going to work together as I had hoped. Then things went from bad to worse and I could no longer control What speaker my TV was using and Echo Dot decided to randomly use Bluetooth to connect with my soundbar and alternately the speaker in the unit. I finally shut it down and was unable to play music all night at my New Year's Eve party using Echo Dot. It took me an hour the next morning to get the sound back on my TV. I am also unhappy because Alexa does not understand or have answers for most of my questions. I chose this Google because it looked like it could do more. But I will probably return it.","January 2, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","CG","Way cool and great price","My Dot arrived yesterday, and within an hour I was all set up. By set up, I mean at bedtime I walked into the bedroom and told Alexa to dim the bedroom lights, arm the security system, turn down the thermostat, set my alarm for six am, and play meditation music. I woke in the middle of the night, and instead of fumbling for my phone, I just asked Alexa for the time. Then this morning, Alexa turned on the lights, told me the weather, what's on my calendar, and played some upbeat tunes while I got ready for work. I will get one more Dot for the kitchen/family room. The range is good, but if you have more than one story, you will need at least two. I also like that my security company will not let Alexa disarm the system. She can only arm it. The speaker quality is not terrible for this little disc, but an external speaker would help. It takes a little patience. Alexa does get smarter with use as it learns your voice and patterns (unlike Siri, which seems to be getting dumber). It's early, but I already see vast differences between the quality of Alexa and Siri. Lastly, I paired it with the Hue starter kit, so the Dot only cost about $41. Great value!","November 11, 2016"

I have Echo in the living room and The Echo Dot in my bedroom. First off there are more differences between the two than just the speaker. I have no issues with the speaker on the Dot. It is loud and sounds great for its size. The issue on the Dot is the delay upon command, also loses Internet connection multiple times(my speed is 200mbps). I have the Dot hooked up to two smart light bulbs for each of my lamps and from time to time has trouble distinguishing between the two (even though they are both named bedroom 1 and 2). Now as far as the Echo (tall one) in my living room, I got it last Christmas and have it hooked up to one lamp. I have never had one issue. It responds to all commands instantly. Never lost Internet connection and works flawlessly. So if you are looking to buy Echo as you main device spend the extra money and buy the original(tall one) you will not be disappointed!!! The Echo Dot is a great secondary device but definitely not my first choice.  Hope this helps your decision.","December 31, 2016"

Have to ask questions multiple times. Dot misunderstands and doesn't do what you ask. Thought there was something wrong with my unit. Had to phone amazon and was told the speaker is different on the dot and not as good. It is tedious to use and can be a big pain in the butt to get it to understand you and give you what you asked for.Would not recommend.","March 7, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Gary Hays Jr.","More than we expected","I received an Amazon Echo Dot for Christmas to use in conjunction with the Phillips Hue Lights I was getting. My original plan was to just be able to voice control my lights and Alexa was basically going to be a voice controller but she's so much more and my wife and I love it.We use Alexa to, of course, raise and lower the lights as we see fit but also to answer randoms questions that we may have as well as set timers for food.I also use Alexa to set reminders on my Google Calendar.The most unexpected thing that we use Alexa for is to play music. I knew it had the capability but never really considered it to be something we'd do on a regular basis but at least one a day we ask Alexa to open Pandora for us. I was worried that the sound wouldn't be too great since the biggest difference between the Dot and the original model is the speaker but it sounds great for the easy listening that we do.All around, for the price we paid, we couldn't be happier and will be ordering at least two more in the future for the bedroom and the kitchen.","December 29, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Average dude","More useful than you might think...","I personally love my Dot, however my Australian Shephard roommate does tend to get very jealous. I believe my dog thinks I have adopted another animal named Alexa who I much prefer. But honestly, Alexa is way better at picking good music than my dog is. I have a few smart light bulbs ($20-$30 on Amazon) that are all hooked up to Alexa, and can be dimmed and controlled by it. Set up is really simple and takes about ten minutes (including the light bulbs I purchased). I have never actually used a voice only device that works so well. This thing almost never misunderstands me, and when it does you can let it know it was wrong.Don't forget about how awesome cards are people! Some people forget that you can see what Alexa is telling you about on your phone. Miss part of that recipe? You can easily look at the app for details.My daily use is usually starting my morning with an alarm, checking my flash briefings, asking her to play music ($3.99 for Amazon Music Unlimited if you have prime and you only use it on your dot), remembering a song and searching for it by lyrics,(""Alexa whats that one song that goes like you spin my head right round right round""),and more.DEVELOPERS:This thing is heavily supported by Amazon and their ecosystem. They have a ton of great documentation on how to create voice ""skills"" (apps) for Alexa. You can get a basic one up and running in a day if you are familiar with Node JS. If you code at all, or are interested in learning, I honestly can say Alexa is the easiest thing I've ever developed with, and the support system is pretty great. I personally won my Dot by making a skill in a hackathon with a group of fellow coders. The speech recognition is amazing, even if you have an accent too.TL;DR: My dog hates me for adopting another invisible dog named Alexa.","April 16, 2017"

Mine lasted less then 60 days.","I have loved most of my Amazon devices, and really enjoyed this one for the 2 months it worked.  I think the device has a LOT of potential, but the ball has been dropped on this one.I have two.  One upstairs on wireless 1, one downstairs on wireless 2.  Wireless 1 dies this last week, so I have spent some time trying to get the Echo up and running on wireless 2 (which is actually the stronger wireless).  Spent a couple nights, finally called Amazon today and spent over an hour on a call between a couple of people, to be told ""Oh, it must be defective.  Send it back, we will fix it or send you a replacement in 14 days""Seriously?  I have it for 2 months, and and have to send it back and wait 2 weeks?  If it was a year old, I would understand that, but is barely out of the return window!I had planned to pick up a couple more... not so sure now.  Too new I guess to be reliable yet.  Great idea, but just not good support behind it.  Convenient that by the time the item is returned to me, it will be beyond the return windows.  Very disappointed with this one.","January 28, 2017"

If you aren't into Home Automation,  and you listen to music often. Then I would highly recommend subscribing to Amazon Prime and getting an Echo. We both enjoy the sounds of nature lulling us to sleep, and the Celebrity wake up can be as funny as it is creepy. I purchased 2 and have full house coverage. 40 feet distance it still hears our commands clearly. It works well with both Wink and Smarthings as well as my D-Link smartswitches and ecobee3 smart thermostat. It also works well with IFTT.I did have an issue setting alarms, but discovered unplugging it and plugging back in, solved. Of all my tech, this is and has been the most useful. We use it to cook and set timers, alarms to wake us and remind us, set to do and shopping lists. Get the weather and local news briefs. Seriously fantastic.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Debbie","Connection issues and frequent reboots.","I may have gotten a flawed device: frequently cuts out when playing music, often disconnects from wifi, microphone sensitivity is not good. My Echo Dot sits some 15 feet (at the most) from our wireless router and ofter has disconnects and trouble playing music. Although I am impressed with this technology, how can it review it with my full liking when connection issues persist? I spoke with a co-worker who owns one and theirs has few connection issues, in fact, she said it only once disconnected with a red ring, but came back and has been flawless in it's function. In our case, we often have to yell at the thing to get a response. Still, when it is functioning it works well and has a good connection to our bluetooth speakers, one being a Bose SoundLink with impressive sound quality generated. Other reviews spoke of poor sound quality generated via bluetooth, this is a point in which I see no issue, perhaps this has something to do with the type of bluetooth speaker. Note: The wifi/network connection issues persist with and without bluetooth speaker connected.","December 26, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Cajun Cajole","Great investment!","This thing is fantastic! Not to mention the price isn't bad for everything you can do with it. It's a great little hands-free device. It fits pretty much anywhere, with it being so small and compact. The speaker quality isn't bad and I had my doubts!I always play Pandora while I paint, sketch, ink or color. Before owning the Echo Dot (2nd Gen), I was constantly having to stop, make sure my hands were paint free and shake the mouse in order to get it out of idle mode so I could see what song was playing or to skip a song. Now, I just tell Alexa to skip or ask what song it is. It's useful for setting alarms, timers, getting the weather, traffic, etc. I've used it to get hours of stores and restaurants so I wasn't ""that customer"" walking in 10 minutes before a place closed. Alexa is also pretty funny. Ask her if she likes cats. Her response is quite cheesy, but I love it!All in all, I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a hands-free radio, alarm, timer, etc. If you're into fun little gadgets, this is up your alley!","January 25, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Larry","Unbelievable little magic cube","I love the Echo dot, it is like having a HAL 9000 computer in your home, the ""ask my buddy"" skill is so important, we can have Alexa call anyone  on our buddy list or call everyone at once, and Alexa will call and text them that we need help, its not a substitute for calling ""911"", but if someone is injured and can't reach the phone it is invaluable.The ""Akinator ""Skill is so impressive, Alexa will guess anyone you can think of by asking you questions, its possessed!the Fidelity Skill, is so useful for stock quotes, and the ask the bartender was very helpful making drinks. My personal favorite is ask the dog if we fed her, Alexa will remember the last time the dogs were fed, we never know who feeds the dog, when were all not around.I also love the Jeopardy Skill, we can play for hours. there is also a Expedia skill that when pared with your account will give you all the info you can get on your computer.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","John","Alexa just keeps getting better each day...","We are amazed at what Alexa can do on a daily basis.  We originally purchased the Amazon Echo when it was first released to Prime members years ago.  We have loved everything Alexa does at our house (sets lights with our Hue system and controls the temperature with our Nest) as well as all the functions (games, trivia, weather, news, etc.). that it provides.  We decided to purchase an Echo Dot for use in our upstairs bedroom and it has been a wonderful addition to an already great product.  The Echo Dot connected well to an old Bose stereo we had boxed up and put away.  This pairing has turned our Bose into an internet radio with a ton of new features.  Even if you don't have a radio or stereo to pair the dot with, the speaker on the dot is sufficient enough to listen to music and hear Alexa's commands.  Paired with an external speaker, however, the dot really shines.  We have several Apple products in our house, but Siri can't hold a candle to what Alexa is capable of.  It's truly like having a virtual robotic assistant in your house.","December 27, 2016"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Samantha","Cannot connect to Bluetooth devices","I am excited about all the cool features of echo dot BUT the main reason I was glad I was gifted it was to be able to pair via Bluetooth to my Soundbot SB1010 speakers. All my Bluetooth devices show up on my phone with the proper names, ""Bose"", ""SB1010"", etc. but devices on Echo dot show up as these weird codes (see photo) so I do not know which one is mine. I live in a large apartment building so perhaps these are my neighbors.Granted, I tried connecting to all 8 of the listed, and Alexa could not connect to a single one, nor could I verify which of them were for my Bose or Soundbot. And yes, I am certain their Bluetooth pairing was in fact enabled.I have not seen anyone else with this issue.

I purchased this in hopes I could get it somehow to contact someone should I ever need help.  I found an app called MyBuddy.  I entered the names and contact info of those I wanted contacted in the event I need help.  All I have to do now is say Alexa, ask My Buddy to contact (either all or just one) say the name and It calls them, sends them a text and will send them a text stating that I need help.... I ask her about the weather, how to spell words while I am writing something or directions.  I ask her pretty much anything, like I was told many years ago ""you don't know until you ask""  So just #AskAlexa  I also love the music library.  Sometimes I take a longer shower than normal so now all I gotta do is ask Alexa to play what ever..  The only think I haven't quiet figured out how to correct is if you place a speaker too close to her and are playing music she cant hear you when you call.

My apartment is only about 450 square feet, and I have tried placing the Echo in several locations but have had this problem even when I'm within a few feet  of the Echo, especially if there is not a straight line of sight.I really wanted to like this, but I suspect it's destined for a box in the closet where I put things I I don't use but wish I wanted to use.","January 26, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Kylie&TheCats","Not meant to be used on its own","The Echo Dot isn't very loud, even for a small space, so that was a disappointment. The number of apps it can connect to is limited; I have had trouble getting it to play podcasts, for instance. I believe it would function better with the ""smart home"" accessories, but it really isn't meant to be used alone.Alexa also doesn't really seem to live up to the hype. Reviews have rated her as more responsive than Siri, but she doesn't seem to have a lot of answers. However, when I ask some questions, the explanation is typically more in-depth than Siri. (For example, ""what happened to Carrie Fisher?"" returned a brief explanation of her death and highlights of her life.) Alexa's capabilities are updated weekly--but memorizing the functions isn't exactly practical.I hope that more time with the Echo Dot will allow me (and Alexa!) to learn more and unlock more functions.","April 2, 2017"

She uses it to turn her lights on and off (in combination with Phillips Hue), listen to music via our Amazon Prime account, ask questions while doing her homework and even just ""Hey Alexa, what is the weather?"" when she is getting dressed for school in the morning.There is much debate about playing music on this model.  For her and in her bedroom, this works quite well.  Yes, the Echo is a better speak and is better for music -- but this sounds OK in a small room. We did end up plugging some desktop computer speakers into it so she could listen to music at a higher quality, but this isn't bad for a small office or small room to listen to Pandora, Amazon or other music at low volume.","April 15, 2017"

I've LOVED it, but I don't think I would have bought it for $180. Once I got a Spotify premium account, the music benefits became much stronger than it was when I just had access to prime music, but I'm still not sure I would pay $180 for it. At $50 ($42 when you buy in a six pack like my family did), it's a MUST BUY.Second, I love the size. The original was a bit unwieldy.Finally, with an audio out, I can connect it to speakers that are appropriate for the task. I have one in my bedroom without any speaker at all. It's good enough for an alarm clock and to read me weather reports and the occasional query. I don't need music there. In my office, I've got it connected to bigger speakers. I listen to music primarily as I'm sitting in front of my computer for most queries. And in the kitchen, I've got my old echo for many cooking related and general queries, alarms and timers, and occasional music.Go out and buy one today!","November 4, 2016"

You can link it to Pandora and Spotify (must be a paying member, not a freeloader) but really you can just say ""Alexa, play Baroque"" for example, and voila. Great for linking to iHeart radio. Best of all, you can sleep-timer these applications with a simple ""Alexa, ** minute sleep timer.""Once your friends and relatives see how great and easy to use, they'll order one for themselves.

Definitely money well spent for as much as she can do not worry too much because it is a cloud service so it should only get better.

If you are a first time Echo user, you may be disappointed right away when you listen to this device using the built-in speaker.

I usually ask Alexa what's going on outside or in the news, and I can clean the dishes or get lunch ready, and save the time I'd otherwise spend reading on my tablet. Hilariously, she has no issue recognizing my voice, but not so for my wife, who has to scream at Alexa for some reason.Alexa's skill set is impressive, but I do wish there were some basic things she could do better. The timer/reminder functions are lacking and oversimple. I should be able to add things to a to do list, or remove them, without correcting them on my phone. I should also be able to assign reminders to those items, but so far, this seems a little complicated.I am really holding out for Sonos integration. If that works out nicely - and I can use Google Music - I may get an Echo Dot for every room in the house.","February 15, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","RDC","Very cool and useful.","So far the Dot is a neat product.  However, it needs greater support from the various smart devices and software developers.  In the next 2 years this product will be a rock star.  I give it four star because if you know the commands it will respond well with few mistakes. In addition, the app provides a second layer to enhance the experience.  For example, I set a timer, walked away too far for Alexa to hear me asking to stop the alarm when the timer was done so I went to the app and was able to stop it.  If you're in the fence or think it's guimicky try it and you enjoy it and be ready for when it'll be robust enough to do most things around the house.  Now I have it connected with the Harmony remote to control my TV, Philips lights around the house, and SmartThings hub.  It does a fair job with these functions.  Oh, did I mention the kids love it and my wife is getting used to it ;).  It's a work in progress to learn it and get each system to work the way to want it to but will be all worth it. Good luck and enjoy!","November 30, 2016"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Jeff","OK product. Doesn't work some of the times. Doesn't add much value to my life.","Not a fan. It was sporadic at best, glitched many times, and wasn't very adaptive at realizing what I wanted to say. Plus, there's not really much out there that I'd need this for anyways.Sure, it's great for setting alarms and telling it to play music on your bluetooth speakers, but these are all things that can be done with your phone and this only provides a TINY convenience factor...when it works. When it doesn't work, it's frustrating to no end.As this product is now, I'd rather be guaranteed my actions work by using a phone and doing things ""the old way"".","January 22, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Chiraag","AMAZING!","Love it! It helps me out with so many things in the house! Like I can just say ""Alexa turn of the lights"" and I don't even have to get up! It is also very intuitive. I myself use the jeopardy function and its amazing! It helped me learn so many new things! It also can tell you scores of the latest sports! Even out of all of these things. the most interesting thing that really caught my attention was the music. You can say ""Alexa play 92.3 AMP radio"" then she plays 92.3 live! This product is very cool, and I hope that more features are added!","February 24, 2017"

I was watching TV and I did not even mentioned Alexa's name to wake her up and suddenly Alexa talked loudly (might be on volume 7) saying can't find an answer to the question. This could be annoying specially if I am fast asleep at night. Imagine waking you up in the middle of the night. Three times that I noticed this already.I suggest to print the name of ""Alexa"" opposite the Amazon logo. I mean on the other side opposite the logo.","January 6, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Jackie and Brian","Dot is a must have purchase","The system works great!  I've got it integrated with my SmartThings home automation system and I love that I can just say ""Alexa, open the blinds"" and our wood window blinds will automatically open!  You know all of the other things you can do with the Dot/Echo so I won't run them all down.  I was surprised that with the Dot, you still have a small speaker it is sufficient to hear Alexa's responses to your queries.  However, it really shouldn't be used to play music. If you already have a bluetooth speaker, simply pair it with the Dot and you've got the equivalent to the larger Echo unit!One thing... make sure if you already own an Echo that you install your Dot in a location of your home where Echo can't listen in.  We installed our Dot in a room not very far from our main Echo unit.  Sometimes, a simple command like ""Alexa, set timer for 5 minutes"" will be answered by the Echo in the Kitchen while others the Dot around the corner in the Living Room will faintly respond.","January 14, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","J.Tollefson","Amazing Product at a Great Price!!!","I purchased the All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) as a Christmas gift for my brother, 36 years old. He was in love the minute he opened his gift. He couldn't wait to get home and see what this product could do. Now I haven't had time to follow up with him to see how he likes it since setting it up, using it, etc...but I also have not heard any complaints either. My grandmother did also purchase a Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker II to accompany this Echo Dot so he would have amazing sound for playing music via his new Echo Dot. I would highly recommend this product as a gift or for yourself. I did happen to also purchase this item (Echo Dot) for my son, who is 13 years old, and he loves it. It was easy to set up right out of the package and he has paired his Echo Dot to a BOSE SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II and the sound is amazing. Alexa is very responsive and has proven to be a fun addition to our tech savvy household.  I would have no doubts about buying more for our household.","December 28, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Jake Langstrom","Fun and Useful","Totally love it.  People tell me the Google device is better but I don't want to believe it.  There are so many wonderful ""skills"" my Dot has available.  I've spent two days in a row testing out everything I can do on my Dot.  I love that it can play almost any song you can think of.  You can get facts, figures, and weather from all over the world.  Every now and then it may misunderstand what you're asking it to do but that's rare and usually caused by the lack of the users diction.  Normally you can talk in a regular voice and Alexa will hear you, even from across the room.  You can get a news brief featuring whatever news outlets you choose to include.  The Dot's wake up word can be Alexa, Dot, Echo or Amazon.  However, I was sitting near my Dot last night and watching a movie on TV.  I said, regarding the hero's peril, ""I feel it's hopeless.""  My Dot then spoke up and encouraged me to contact the suicide hotline and gave me the number to call.  So...it's always listening.","February 12, 2017"

If the house is completely silent, she can hear me from the other room. If there is any noise at all, my wife has to pick her up and speak directly at her, so I would say that the microphone could be better or perhaps just noise discrimination could be better. Clearly, we have anthropomorphised her since we call her Dot and not ""that hockey puck on the table.""I find her voice a bit robotic and when playing Jeopardy I sometimes have trouble understanding the category or question. It is also frustrating when I answer correctly and she says, ""That is incorrect.""She also loses connection to our wi-fi occasionally. We have to pull her plug and then resuscitate her. Nothing else seems to fix that problem.","April 15, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Candice","Alexa is amazing","I was really excited when I was gifted the latest Echo Dot after pining over the regular Echo for quite some time. It turned out to be everything I hoped for. I started out by going through the voice training a couple of times to ensure the best experience.The voice recognition is really great. My boyfriend has to pay a little more care to his enunciation to get Alexa to know what he's saying, but I'm sure if he did the voice training, the issues would go away. The skill selection is not bad, but still limited. I have been following some forums for the product and excited to maybe write something of my own for it. The highest volume setting isn't very loud, but works in the smaller setting it's intended for.In the morning, I ask Alexa to give me a rundown of the news, which includes NPR, BBC, local news, and the weather. I played a choose-your-adventure game while doing the dishes. I ask Alexa to quote random Rules of Acquisition or cat facts. She's awesome.","December 7, 2016"

I can yell from the shower and she hears me all the way across the bathroom and master bedroom to change the station or change the volume. I also found some pretty funny Easter egg type things to ask Alexa and have been entertained.  I also added some apps in the Alexa app. If you don't have a speaker, get the full size. If you have a nice speaker (I have a UE Boom full size) then the Dot will be fine. I keep them connected to power and through a speaker cord. No big deal. I have another plugged into my surround sound receiver. Works great.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Rose Collum","The Dot is Great, the Alexa App for iPhone and iPad is awful.","Even though the Dot itself is a great tool (I have three of them), the Alexa application for Apple products is never online so I can't manage or edit my shopping list, to-do lists, Calendar items, and alarms.  The only way to get it back online is to restart my iPad and iPhone, which is inconvenient.  I was forced to use a shopping list application from the AppStore instead of the Alexa app.Also, if you set alarms for the same time Monday through Friday and want to stop just one alarm for one day, it cancels all the alarms so I'm forced to restart my iPhone to get the Alexa app to engage and then I'm able to restore the alarms.  The only way around this is to set individual alarms for each day, but you are still not able to ""pause"" an alarm without cancelling them entirely.  (and yes, my iPhone patches are up to date)Outside of that, it's great getting the weather, setting timers, playing music from pandora, and lots of other features.","January 29, 2017"

You say good night to her and she wishes you a restful night.I would like to point out that the microphones are just as sensitive as advertised. In fact, maybe a lot more. Every time there is an Echo Dot commercial on our TV and they say, ""Alexa"", our Alexa answers up.

That said, if you don't require the full-size speaker of the original Echo, or you want to stream Prime Music from your stereo, this is great bang for the buck.The only improvement I'd really love to see is for it to auto sense whether the stereo it's connected to is on or off.  As it stands, if it's plugged into a speaker/stereo and that connected device is turned off, you have zero sound. Plugging and unplugging the Echo Dot's audio cable is an unnecessary nuisance.  If a cheap on-board sound card chip can figure out where to direct audio (headphone jack vs. speakers), why can't the Dot?Still, if you don't already have a few Amazon Echos around the house (we have 3), it's more cost effective to buy a few Echo Dots to scatter around the house, especially if you already own a decent Bluetooth Portable Speaker.","January 28, 2017"

I can't really here it over the dishwasher when it's running. Biggest draw back is that each unit is independent so they don't communicate with each other. So if I play music on one, none of the other dots or echo's play. Also it is nearly impossible to look up individual episodes of podcasts. The voice control works really well, but the mobile controls absolutely suck! You are pretty much limited to pause/play and volume controls. There is no search function for individual podcasts which is plain stupid. Also the Alexa app is brutally slow and there is no search function for the ""skills."" Which doesn't really matter because the skills that are available are pretty much useless.Overall I do like it.

It also stopped recognizing my Oonz bluetooth speaker. Finally, customer service sent me the new DOT as a replacement. For a time (one or two weeks) the new device worked great.However, I'm having the same voice recognition issue. I'm having to practically stand over it and scream at it. It does however recognize my bluetooth speaker but for how long, who knows? I really like the echo as it has great potential. i like the new Amazon music service, the ability to set multiple timers and manage my Phillips Hue lights, ask for the weather forecast and time. But i really wish they would get this voice recognition thing worked out. I won't be purchasing any additional devices until this gets resolved.","November 13, 2016"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Mr. M","It's the future now","I haven't used all of it's features yet, but so far I love it.  I bought it to replace my aging alarm clock, and setup was so easy.  Then all the other things it can do just make it a cool device.  I will eventually purchase some wifi enabled smart plugs and really see what it can do.  For $50 ($40 when on sale) you can't go wrong.  Only improvement I would suggest is adding a backup battery in case of power loss.  Alexa told me that she does not have a battery (yes I asked her).UPDATE: Two small frustrations that I have noticed lately.  1) I use it as an alarm clock and it has a hard time hearing my voice in the morning when I try to set it to snooze.  2) When attempting to cancel my alarm, with more than one alarm set, it talks through all that want to be cancelled.  Problem is that I am usually in the cycle with the alarm I want off.  Also, at 5:30 AM going through all alarms is kind of annoying.  Might try changing how I word it to see if that fixes it.","January 5, 2017"

I normally have to check a couple different sites before I leave in the winter and now I just ask Alexa. My son loves asking for jokes!

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Shea Storer","Could be a 2 could be a 5 depends on the day and how bad the bing search results are. Also sometimes I feel like Alexa hates me.","Good needs to get better. Its just so dumb. It can do so much but it can not understand anything that isn't exactly how it wants it. It also needs to learn to tie what you are asking together. For instance if you ask it something it will not get it, you ask it another way it still doesn't understand. Between multiple questions it should tie together you are asking about something specific. Each request is independent from any other request except with music. Has potential barley a 4 star rating could make it to 5. However sometimes the horrible bing results make it a 2. I would prefer to choose my search results and change them to more accurate info on google. At one point I was asking it what happened in 2007 and it told me the Vietnam war and Tienanmen square. I complained and it was fixed. However I have seen other poor to inaccurate information. I do like the Bluetooth ability and the plug in ability to make a better sounding device play my music.","January 5, 2017"

The Dot will be used for mostly local stuff like weather, sport scores, timer function and the like.  I find the speaker to be more than adequate for my needs.  Can't speak for the sound quality for you music buffs out there.  I'll probably buy another one for the family room.  I think my wife will confiscate this one for the kitchen.  She likes local weather etc. without fiddling with the computer.  The music selection on Amazon Prime is outstanding.  We are not serious music buffs but as yet I haven't heard anything that I haven't heard before,  anything from Country &Western to John Denver.  Bear in mind though that I'm not  youngster.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","I like this product","I like this product, and I think it's got a lot of potential but, at least regarding prime music, it also lacks some functionality that I consider pretty basic.When Alexa shuffles my music list, it seems that the shuffle isn't random. I hear the same songs by the same artists too often. And some songs on my list I never hear. Also, I've taken the time to select music I like and added those songs to my playlist. So when I request a song, and there are multiple versions of that song by different artists, I expect to hear the version I've selected. Alexa often plays some other version that I didn't select and don't like. Also, I clearly have kids in the house, since we play kids music on Amazon radio. Why does Alexa add the ""explicit"" version of songs by default? These shortcomings are both perplexing and annoying. Amazon, please fix. I want to like this product more and will certainly stick with it, but please make some easy improvements.","December 2, 2016"

When I wake up, I can have Alexa give me the weather and any reminders for the day.

Pretty much anything I want to know, I just ask. She even plays games (you got nothing on me when it comes to Simpsons trivia, Alexa!). Why can't life always be this easy?Definitely considering buying another one for the other room in the new apartment. And I definitely recommend to anyone.One suggestion to anyone buying, however. Make sure you have a good speaker to attach it to because the sound isn't great out of the dot itself (which is understandable given its size and cost).

I feel obligated to say please at the end so that when Echo has complete control over me she is a kind overlord.There are two things that could make this device better: an HDMI port to control TV much like the Firestick, and the ability to call it something else (my vote is for J.A.R.V.I.S.)","January 9, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","W. Ezell","Great fun and actually useful","I love this little gadget. It's not perfect, but it's still useful. The biggest shortcoming is the lack of good integrations with other smart devices. This isn't Amazon's fault, though, it's the companies doing the integrations. Example, I have a Logitech Harmony Hub. Ok, there's a ""skill"" for that. But, it's pretty limited and not trivial to set up and manage. It does enough to be useful but has many shortcomings. Is this an Echo problem? No, it's a Logitech problem, but it's still annoying.One really nice feature would be context-dependent commands. For example, if I say 'Alexa turn on tv', I should then be able to say 'volume up' and have that be specific to the current activity. Unfortunately, unless you're using one of the older V1 API apps, the command space seems to be flat. Every command has to be unique from every other command, at least from what I can tell now. This is quite limiting.But, I like it so much I bought a second one.","November 10, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Jon P.","I love all 3 of the one I just bought","I have loved my Amazon Echo that I have had for nearly 2 years.  I love being able to use the Amazon Echo for voice control of my living room lights and other compatible devices (i.e. my Nest thermostat).  The cost of the Amazon Echo was the only thing holding me back from putting one in other parts of the house.  As soon as I saw the Echo Dot (2nd gen) advertised for sale I immediately ordered 3 of them to put in other parts of my house.  I already had a good speaker system in my bedroom so I added a Dot there.  I put another in my wife's office and attached a set of Bose speakers and I put one in the Kitchen (no external speakers but that one is not for listening to music).All 3 Dots were incredibly easy to set up and all are working perfectly.  The only difference I noticed about them compared to the Amazon Echo (besides the sound quality) is the dots seem to take slightly longer to turn my lights on and off.  I am not 100% sure they take longer but it seems like they are just a bit slower but not enough to really make a difference.","October 24, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Mary Yates","They are amazing and work really well","I have three of these in my house now. They are amazing and work really well. Over the Christmas Holiday I made sugar cookies. I kept the echo dot in the kitchen with me playing music. I was able to set timers for the cookies in the oven while cutting out more shapes and getting more pans ready. It was a huge help for me and the cookies turned out perfectly. I give full credit to their success to the help of the echo dot as cookies have never been my strong suit. I get news reports and keep my home filled with music. The app is really easy to use as well.The one thing I would like to mention to everyone though is these must be plugged into power constantly as there is no batter. It's like your lamp or TV. If you want it to work, it must be plugged it. This makes moving them from room to room annoying as you have to wait for it to restart. Eventually you may realize one is not enough; I know I didn.","January 6, 2017"

I got an added benefit by the unit connecting to a Lightify (Osram) lighting system.  The system is a PITA because the app crashes multiple times per day and I have been sending crash reports to the OEM for months (and they ignore me).  I was about to scrap the system and give the Phillips system a shot.  So after I got the DOT connected, I noticed that it had an option to connect to Lightify.  The system works very nice now with the DOT in controlling my lights.  I don't know if it will do dimming or color temperature at this point but I don't care (It does everything, including moods!).  The fact that I can turn the darn things off and on simply by voice saved these from a garage sale or worse.  I also note that the DOT works across different systems.  My thermostat is an Emerson Sensi and my lights are by Phillips.  I wonder what other brands it will become compatible with?","November 16, 2016"

Still I didn't get how bad the Alexa is set up for . Firstly, skills? Be warned the Amazon device isn't like your phone, where you just ask it to do something and it does it. Nope, you will within the first few mins told you need to download the skill. I will just leave it at that for now. My Google device, I ask it, it answers! Simple. Like a previous verified purchaser, bought this as a way to offer a bit more independence a disabled parent, wrong.

I'm looking at upgrading to the Echo bad boy, but for the time being this thing is sweet and has so much potential for what I'm going to do. Will come in very handy around the house, being able to control my Thermostat or my lighting when I'm in a completely different room.

So I had to call Amazon and they were nice, patient, and a big help walking me through setting it up through my computer but unfortunately I am not getting to use my Echo Dot to the fullest because I can not use the app which Alexa likes to remind me that I could do this or that by accessing the app...wish I could.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Packer Backer","More fun than useful, more novelty than necessity","There is a lot to like and a lot that is frustrating.  I think of the Echo Dot as a way to quickly get the weather if my phone isn't handy and it is a novelty for guests or grand kids, but its best use seems to be in providing trivial pursuit type of information- nice to know, but not really useful.  I know, it is only as good as the questions asked, but my experience has been that asking specific questions often gets you the 'Sorry, I can't find the answer to the question I heard"" response.It is a fun toy, but I wouldn't bet my term paper on Alexa's information.The range of the unit is very good.  Our house is large and Alexa can pick up a question from quite a distance.  The unit is also good at setting alarms, playing a variety of music, compiling a shopping list and turning of lights etc. if you are willing to get the necessary hardware that 'speaks Alexa's language"".","January 23, 2017"

Apparently the fact that it was a DEFECTIVE item that died after about three weeks was lost on them.And then to stick it to me even more, I didn't even get my full purchase price back.

This is without any type of paid subscription to Prime Music or other service.  If I ask for a specific song, it is sometimes a different story.  For a specific song, Alexa may play a sample of the music and then offer to help me purchase it.  Connected effortlessly to my Bluetooth speaker for a better sound.  I get weather reports, news updates, and a nice music player from the Echo Dot, and I've just began discovering the possibilities.The initial setup was a little confusing as it really tries to steer you towards installing an app on your phone in order to complete the set-up.  That wasn't necessary, but the instructions made me feel like it was.","January 3, 2017"

The book store cost 15.00 a month and then the books cost 2x what a hard copy book cost. So if you see a book for 10.00 on amazon it cost 20-35 dollars on audio from a Amazon sister company. I already pay for prime which cost 10.00 a month so if you want everything. Be prepared to pay 30.00 a month plus book cost. If you want it for just turning on tv light etc...it's great awesome product but the pay for play stuff is stupid at the price. If each one cost 2 to 3 dollars I could see paying it.

I'm still learning about the other things that are useful, and used it to reorder an item for the first time the other day.  It went smoothly and asked me for appropriate confirmation, etc.One thing I appreciate about the Echo over Siri on my Apple Devices is that the Echo is not ""chatty"".  I ask it to do something, it is done, and Alexa simply responds with ""OK"".  Siri seems to have to repeat the entire command you gave it and is just overly wordy when it comes to using it as a command center.

It's not so good on ""Wolfram-Alpha"" type questions: for instance, I tried to ask it what date was 7 weeks from January 8 and it didn't get it.

Just knowing that we had several three letter agencies listening to us made us feel really important. Now we keep Alexa / them in 5 gallon bucket filled with water.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","CherAmi","Mostly awesome","Pros: answers questions quickly and accurately. Home automation works great. I use it to control my phillips hue lights, set timers, alarms, get conversions of measurements while cooking. Very handy.Cons: the only time the echo dot seems to not hear me, is when I'm playing music from it, or when I have an alarm set for it that goes off. There have been scenarios where I set a wake alarm, then try to verbally tell echo to stop, but the wake word doesn't work and so she doesn't respond. I assume the alarm noise or music drowns out my voice. And so I end up using the phone app to kill the alarm.Not game breaking as I can work around that. Conclusion: Overall very happy with it. If you are looking to automate your home, or finding yourself googling things frequently, what felt initially like a neat gimic soon became something I realized made a lot of things more convenient for me the more I used it. Love my echo.","November 4, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Patrick","Extended voice control throughout the home","I bought full-size Echo pretty early on when they came out, and wanted to extend the ability to do voice commands elsewhere throughout my home. I bought two of the Echo Dots, and put one in the bedroom and one in the basement. I primarily use these to do voice commands to WeMo switches, although we do find ourselves playing music over them as well, and it doesn't sound too bad... basically like any other small Bluetooth speaker you've ever used, except way smarter.The only issue I've had is that I couldn't get these to stay connected to wifi when they were connecting via my wifi range extender. As soon as I'd unplug the range extender, they'd work... so that's probably more of an issue with the range extender than these units, but not sure. I just renamed my extended range network and sync'd these to the primary wifi network off my main router, and they're rock solid.","February 17, 2017"

I am a big electronics guy and have my old yamaha receiver and good old school bose speaker set up and this blew me away. Being able to have it play music without the pain of finding my phone and letting it die slowly just to listen to music is worth it alone. Not to mention the crazy amount of skills and features. I have a smart tv but no smart hub. I am looking into buying one and will update this when I do. As for its quality that is another area where I was blown away but what do you expect from amazon!! Great quality and unsurpassed usefulness. It even tells my baby boy stories! He doesn't understand what or who is talking but he finds it entertaining! Very very highly recommended if you have connectivity issues just make sure you have the app installed and everything is plugged in properly. It really is a SMART home device!!","December 24, 2016"

I attached the dot to an acrylic pedestal which holds my Harmon Kardon Bluetooth speaker. I used a small circle of heavy duty Velcro to secure the Echo Dot so there is no strain whatsoever on the connection point.  My television is no more than two feet away and Alexa hears commands first try probably %90 of the time. One of my favorite things being able to make my own playlists on Amazon Music and then just asking for them, fun!  Pandora also works flawlessly.  I'm sure I will be adding lighting with Phillips Hue next. All in all very happy with this product, when I get the calendar figured out it gets the fifth star.","October 24, 2016"

Landers","A great little assistant w/ an Alexa function that is still 'in the works'","The Echo Dot as a unit is well done, it's compact and attractive, affordable and functions as advertised. My only criticism is with the Alexa feature, which is still lacking in a lot of pertinent information. For example, it could not answer these questions: ""How old is the Irish language?"" or ""What is considered the most popular Christmas movie?"" or ""What are the most common names in Portugal?"" or ""What is the age of the oldest person alive?"" or ""What is the record high temperature for this day?"" etc. If you want the weather for Des Moines or the distance in miles from the earth to the moon or anything else that might be already listed on Wikipedia then Alexa will work for you. Saying that. I'm confident Amazon is working on improving the knowledge database of Alexa and my silly questions will be readily answered in the near future.","January 5, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Alexa is the best and the Dot is perfect!","So far this is awesome. My wifi is pretty abismal right now, and I believe that has been leading to loss of connection a few times. But other than that, I LOVE ALEXA! It is seriously so much fun to have this around. Setting alarms for the morning, checking the weather, and random fun other questions you can ask her - it's all so great. I also have it connected to my Phillips Hue bulbs (pretty straight forward, just needed a Phillips Hue online account and access to the bridge one time) and that's really handy as well. Way easier than taking out my phone and the Hue app.The speaker is surprisingly good. As a speaker buff myself, I would never choose this to listen to music for extended periods of time, but it is definitely loud enough for the whole room. For listening to music, I have it hooked up to a bluetooth speaker (TaoTronics) and that works great. Overall, I love this product!","December 1, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Maggie","In love!","I'm in love! I have been pretty slow using all of the Dot's skills with Alexa, but I have been working on them. I have, however, been using it to play music constantly from Amazon Music and I am thrilled with it. I started adding songs to My Music in Amazon Music, but I love to just ask Alexa for a specific artist I love. She shuffles it up, plays my songs, skips when there is a song I don't like, pauses, resumes, adjusts volume levels...It's great! If the volume is up too high, though, she does have trouble hearing me from another room (I have a very small house so I am never far away from it). But if I move closer or raise my voice a little, she gets it. I bought one for my father for Christmas and I can't wait to see if he loves it as much as I do. My sister recommended it to me, and she even bought one for our step-dad, so I think that's a pretty good endorsement, too.","December 18, 2016"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Dan Raether","Great for certain functions, but overwhelmingly underwhelming in other facets.","It does what you ask it, part of the time. When you ask it general questions like, what is the temperature outside or play christmas music it'll do that. But more often than not if you try to ask a more complex question it will not find the answer for it. We, my fiance and I, have found it more difficult to use the Echo Dot for actual use outside of playing music or finding how cold / warm it is outside. I am not sure if it is a problem with the BING browser that it is associated with or if it is something else, or just not recognizing the speech clearly enough. We have also have had a somewhat mixed result of the fact that the Dot will not always recognize our voices, even when the TV is on quietly. We will have to mute completely for it to fully recognize our voices. I do like it overall, it is a great concept, but I just wish that it was a bit more ""complete""","December 24, 2016"

Its a little cheaper a month for the family plan. We got it so they could play and find music and not have to go online. It works great for that. My 73 year old mother in law said she has been listening to music she has not heard in 20 year. I went in her house and she was jamming with Creadance Clearwater revival. She also likes the news and weather on it and the joke of the day.Answering question is another thing. It does a good job but not as good as ""ok google"" on my phone.

I sometimes have to restate my command to ""Play Spike's Christmas music from Spotify"" several times before Alexa gets it right.  So hence the 4 stars.  I wish the system was a bit better at deciphering commands that might vary in wording.  It's not so much yet.  It can learn LOTS of things by adding ""skills"", which is great, but be prepared to have to train yourself on what exactly to say so she understands you.","December 31, 2016"

I would suggest moving it away from the TV so Alexa commercials don't set it off or make it difficult to hear your requests.","March 17, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Shoppin Poppins","Someday will be 4 or 5 stars, but not quite yet","Love the convenience, and would give this item 4 stars -- EXCEPT I wish for the following improvements:1. answer more nuanced questions (for example I hate hearing the entire weather report when all I want is the current temperature)2. actually look up answers to some basic questions about ""stuff"" (I believe Google home does both 1 & 2)3. more things connecting directly without having to program through IFTTT4. the first part of any communication from Alexa always cut off when paired with external speakers and5. most annoying - whatever music I request, I invariably get Christmas music - regardless of what time of year - which is annoying.  For having so many music options, it isn't intuitive to get right to my Amazon music vs. another system (I always thought I was tech-savvy, but the music has me perplexed.)","January 16, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Kyri Lysek","love it","This was a gift for my 9 year old. She absolutely loves it. I connected it to her phone, but she isn't allowed to have her phone in her room all the time. The echo dot will still play music, even when she doesn't have her phone in the room with her. The speaker seems adequate for her purpose, but its not very loud. It does have an auxiliary port to connect speakers to, and will also pair with speakers via Bluetooth. We ended up pairing hers with another speaker, and it seems to be working well. The voice recognition is decent. There are a few words that it wouldn't understand initially, but you can go into the settings and add words for it to ""learn"" that way it will recognize those words in the future. Overall good purchase and you can't beat the price for this type of technology. I will likely purchase more for other rooms in my house.","February 12, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","drama queen","Oh hey, Alexa...","Great product! I received this from a family member over the holidays, as a surprise gift. An Echo Dot was not on my holiday wish list, and I wasn't sure if I would want or need Alexa in my home. I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I have used my Dot. The speakers, while not the best quality, are thoroughly sufficient for playing music in my relatively small room. I had no connectivity issues when linking my Bluetooth speakers, and haven't had any problems communicating with Alexa.The best part of my Echo Dot is that I feel less tethered to my electronic devices; giving Alexa a verbal command saves time and affords me more opportunity to be present in my home than constantly setting alarms, timers, etc. These are all very small things, but they actually make a pretty significant difference in the quality of time spent at home.","January 7, 2017"

I have always wanted to add connectivity to my home but hadn't taken the plunge yet. I'm glad I waited. Got a good deal on Cyber Monday and got a connected plug and the echo dot. Once I got everything up and running I really love telling Alexa to turn the lights on and off, I can also turn them on from work but that's not Alexa related.  I'm now getting into the other functions available like asking about weather, commute to work, playing music and I love it. I know you can hook this up to speakers for premium sound but I'm okay with the basic sound on the dot so far. I really love it. Now I just need to hook up all my other lights and get another dot or two for around the house. I love it! It's so much fun. I was surprised by how much I enjoy the features.","December 6, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","ellen","... as a gift from my husband because I really enjoy listening to audiobooks while I cook","I received the echo dot as a gift from my husband because I really enjoy listening to audiobooks while I cook. Being able to tell Alexa to stop and resume without having to wash my hands to touch anything was the main motivation for the purchase, but it has provided so much more! In my experience, the echo is very responsive to her name (even from rooms away) and she usually understands my requests or questions the first time (better than her apple counterpart in my opinion). There is a learning curve in understanding all her capabilities and offerings. I am still discovering all she can provide. I'd expect she gets software updates regularly and will continue to grow in her capacities. Only definite downside is the ease of purchasing items quickly without having to think twice ;) Overall, a nice asset to a busy home in need of quick responding.","December 23, 2016"

When lying in bed and I want to reach over and adjust the volume, more precisely than asking her, I cannot see to do it and have to get up to look to see which button I need to push.

The most useful features (ranked by frequency of use) are:1. Weather (Alexa, what's the weather like in San Francisco?)2. Music - by far the most useful feature. Here are a couple of commands we find ourselves using a lot:- Alexa, play holiday music on Spotify- Alexa, play my Upbeat Beats playlist on Spotify- Alexa, play Sorry by Justin Bieber- Alexa, turn the volume up (or to a specific number, like 7)3. Alexa, what's my schedule like tomorrow? (Useful for reminding yourself of morning meetings the next day, etc.)We haven't trusted Alexa with ordering items off Amazon for us yet, but it might be a useful tool in the future if there's an specific item that we order pretty regularly (without needing to visit the product page and do research) like shampoo or other toiletries.","December 13, 2016"

A better deal than the standard Echo if you want to set up good speakers and an audio system.","I am on the fence whether this deserves the 4 stars I gave it. It's closer to 3 IMHO.Why? Alexa (I have the full model also) is just not that good with language. They need to make it to understand basic speech better. I love playing music anywhere I have one and so forth. I like the Echo Dot better in some ways than the full Echo as I can hook up a better speaker system and LOUDER.I hate trying to use some of the music commands and others. I find myself having to say things 3 different ways to get what I want. If you use Spotify- it's even tougher. Often I have to say ""On Spotify"" even though it's supposed to be my go to music source. I do like controlling lights and such. Wish the microphone was a bit more sensitive and handled being around loud music better. It's cool for us geeks. Not sure it's a fit for all.","February 22, 2017"

I cannot believe that a users guide doesn't come with this devise. I have never bought anything that wants you to pay extra to learn how to use it. I called an complained and they gave me a credit to buy the instructions. I appreciated that because this devise needs instructions. BTW if you cannot figure something out call customer service for Echo. That is what I did and believe me I think they thought it was worth their time to send me  copy of the book instead of me calling all the time. lol  All in all, after that struggle, I love the thing. Especially for the call for help feature. If I fall and can't get up, lol, all I have to do is say Alexa call my buddy I need help. Love that since I live alone.","February 3, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Shawn Chasse","We love our Echo Dot","We love our Echo Dot. After having a few smart switches and needing to interact with them either physically or via our phones, being able to continue doing whatever it is I am doing and make changes to the lights brings home automation to the next level.Pros:Ability to interact with home automation via voiceAbility to add things to our grocery listsEasy to listen to musicEasy to check status of packagesJeopardy!Cons:Alexa could use a little more natural language capability. We sometimes as questions that are not perfect or that do not fit a formula and alexa responds with ""i don't know how to answer that"" I think the next step for Alexa is being able to interpret any sentence a little better and do smart internet searches in order to get an answer even if it is now perfect.","February 27, 2017"

When I say ""What is on my agenda today?"", it says ""nothing"" because it is the end of the day in the US and the beginning of the day here. Also, even when it tells me about the appointments, it certainly gives me the wrong times (because of the time zone thing).2. It does not work well with tunein. Seldom it gives me the station I pronounce.3. It does not use google search engine but bing. And we know the great difference between the two services.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Canary","Miss the topspin","I bought several of these, to put one in every room. We like the white color better (easier to see in a darkened room) and this version is lighter-weight than the first Dot version.  Basically, all of the new Dots so far are as good as the first version in terms of great voice recognition and decent sound. (For one of these Dots, we  did have to replace a defective power attachment -- but that device now works.) However...we miss being able to turn the ring around the top to quickly change sound up and down. The + and -  buttons now on the device top require us to turn on a light to see which button we are pressing., and it takes several presses to achieve what just a little topspin used to do. Yes, you can tell the device to go lower or higher vocally but speaking sometimes means waking up somebody in the bedroom, Really, the topspin was sooooo cool. Miss it.","November 20, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","T. Dietz","Would buy again at even $50, but love it at $40.","This is a great value at $50, but at $40 it's even worth putting it in rooms you won't use it much in just for the convenience.The reason I got Amazon's setup is because they were the first to integrate with my home automation system (Iris) and it works pretty well.  I've used other voice command modules and this one is reasonably accurate.  I rarely have to repeat things.  The trick with integrating this with a home automation system is to name your devices and groups with things that are very easy to say and very short and distinct, it picks up numbers pretty well (i.e. ""Group 2"" instead of something overly wordy).It's a bummer Google won't integrate with it because they're pushing their own platform, but this works well enough and Amazon seems like they're improving quickly.  At $50/$40 it's not a big risk.","December 23, 2016"

I'm really glad I did. We've only been using Alexa and the dot for 2 days but I feel like I've already gotten my $$ worth out of her. We didn't have a radio hooked up in our house, I know right, get with the times. For just the music alone it's worth the buy! I love that she's able to hear me no matter what room I'm in on the floor of the house we have her in. She's understood what I've asked every single time. I love the ability to get the latest news, weather, and more in an instant. I love that I'm able to set alarms, reminders, and even order via the dot. (Although I've not done this yet, I did set a passcode. It worried me that my toddler could purchase things if he wanted!) Which brings me to the fact that she even understands my 4-year old. He's asked her to play some of his favorite songs and she does, right away. I am an android user and I thought ""I don't need this, we have google and it does everything this alexa does!"" Which is true, but I am so glad we have this now. I'm not sure if I would have preferred one of the bigger models or not, but this has great sound and works very well. My only regret is that I didn't buy one for every floor of my house. I'm excited to start purchasing some of the items that will work throughout our house so she can really be helpful!","December 26, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","John","Very cool, but Not quite ready for prime time","I lurched two of these and a Bose Bluetooth speaker from QVC. I like the concept but it lacks a few freatures/ capabilities I would have expected. 1. There is no way to schedule and event. For example play "" Happy Birthday at 8 AM tomorrow"". 2. There is no keep alive between the echo an the Bluetooth speaker. As a result the Bluetooth device drops off after an hour or so. You must ask Alexa to reconnect the Bluetooth after an inactivity period. 3.  Finally it does not have skills to connect to Hive home automation products if you live in the US. It seems like only the UK has this option. My comment 1. Is the most discouraging. This functionality seems to be a an obvious oversight. One last thought is the skills to Ale a interface. You must reference the skill name to use each skill. This gets tedious when you have several skills","December 18, 2016"

It hears pretty well with the TV on but sometimes I have to say Alexa twice.  Not  a big deal works better than my phone does when I talk to it so it is on the higher end of voice recognition.

Personally, I would insert and remove the adapter a few times just to reassure yourself.  However, there is one thing always to remember about Amazon, customer service is excellent.  Also Amazon stands behind their products -- which is why is why I tend to stay within their echosphere just as I do with Apple.  A new Dot was shipped immediately.

She will then ask you if you are certain that you want to place that order... she can also track orders you already have... the thing I love most about echo dot is that it can play music with just you asking her. you can also ask her for recipes and she will take you through it step by step for when your cooking.

So if you have it in your living room she can hear you from your kitchen... we tried doing it in a normal voice from the living room and she heard us fine! And if you want the volume turned down there is a button on the echo dot to adjust volume. Overall this is something I think everyone should get who needs help in the house... she isn't too fancy or to dumb. She is perfect for my household needs.","April 15, 2017"

It really does not have much value as a work tool. Actually it has very limited use as a toy also. Without a computer of some sort, you won't be able to look up how to control it and to find the apps and skills that can be installed on your account. If you are looking to get one, make sure you try the inexpensive ""Dot"" first. Ours has already lost its luster as a toy and would need several hundreds of dollars of add ons to revive much interest in it. I would have given it a little lower rating except it came as advertised  and I was ready for the limited usefulness it has. It was a stocking stuffer after all, it didn't need to be more than a novelty The real presents were under the tree!","January 20, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Carol G.","Too much fun!","Got my Dot three days ago and can only say that I'm just having too much fun with it.  Within two hours I had it hooked up to my Bowers and Wilkins speaker(I opted to use a cable rather than Bluetooth in this application) and had it controlling my family room lamp via a TP-link lightbulb and my Christmas tree lights with a TP-link plug. The whole setup is amazingly quick and simple as long as you follow the instructions given in the Alexa app and the Kasa app which controls the TP- link devices. And no hub needed with the TP-link devices ... It doesn't get any easier!By the time the afternoon was over, I'd already ordered more Dots, plugs and light bulbs for Christmas gifts ... And yep, another for me.  Received them late yesterday, and now have my second one installed in the bedroom blue toothed to a small speaker/lamp combo.  Frankly, the sound quality of the Echo Dot is good enough for bedside by itself, but I wanted to see if pairing would be a hassle.  Nope ... Another easy installation.Lots of useful skills available for the Dot, but also a lot of junk, too.  Living alone, elderly, and with an iffy health status, 'Ask My Buddy' was of particular interest.  Upon running a test after setup, my son and two friends were notified by text, email and phone that they should check on me because I'd triggered an alert.  Superb!  It isn't going to help if I can't speak to trigger Alexa, but there are much higher odds that I'll trip over one of my 100# dogs in the middle of the night and break something which may prevent me from getting to a phone.  But Alexa's hearing is quite good so she'll likely respond if I yell at her.I haven't as yet been able to stump her on a music genre, but she hasn't been able to locate one or two rather obscure songs I've asked for.  She's also so friendly and poltite when carrying out a task that I find myself saying 'thank you' as if she was real.  In all, Amazon did a great job with this little jewel.  Love it, and will be buying a couple more to cover the rest of the house.","December 9, 2016"

I thought she would be great entertainment and fun but she is so much MORE! The practical uses are inexhaustible!I am a writer and she has told me how to spell words, given me synonyms, and defines any word I ask.She has given me measurement conversions, does basic math, sets timers, and alarms, and keeps my to do list for me. She has looked up phone numbers, zip codes and has even given the population of various cities.She offers an encyclopedia of knowledge on everything from election results, inauguration date, historical dates, holidays and general trivia.She has more manners than most people! Once, asking a question, I stumbled on my words and said, ""I'm sorry."" She sweetly replied, ""That's OK.""She connects to my phone or notebook by just asking. .She greets me good morning, good night and has played ""You are my Sunshine"" every night to my pooch. She tells me the weather, temperature and time  - even in the middle of the night.....AND, I've only had her for a week!Yes, there is a lot of fun to be had asking silly questions like ""Who was Humpty Dumpty?"" and ""Who's on first?""

When an echo device disconnects from the network, for no reason, it does not reconnect and you must go through the entire new device setup to reconnect. The same with the Alexa app. I've done network programming for 20 years and this reflects incompetence. I have three echo dots and they all exhibit this behavior on every wireless network i use at home (3 networks) and work (both networks).  What a shame. Otherwise a great product but for now just a toy with annoying defects. UPDATE:  I still believe the networking -- especially the ability to reconnect to a previously used network -- does need some work.  It is, however, much better than it was.BTW, I started using one in my car, using my cell phone as a WiFi hotspot.  On long drives it is a lot of fun!

We started with the original Echo and loved it.  The original seems the best of the three.  I have it in the home office.  We followed up with a 1st gen Dot when they became available and set it up with a bluetooth speaker in our bedroom.  The third we placed in our kitchen.The first Echo seems most responsive.  It immediately answers questions and requests and the speaker is actually quite good.  However, I think it might be location and placement.  It sits on the counter and there are few ambient noises around.The second in our bedroom works fairly well. We probably use it the most.  The speaker seems a little ""tinny"". We hooked it up to a small bluetooth speaker and it does well.  My wife relocated it to the top of a display cabinet so Alexa struggles to hear there a bit.Our newest addition is the 2nd gen Dot and it was placed in the kitchen.  We have been slower to adopt it to kitchen tasks only because it is habit to set timers and such in there manually.  Adding items to the shopping list is really cool.  If they can add a feature to allow multiple items at a time it would be great.  We do use it a lot for music, internet radio and news etc.  The kitchen Dot does struggle a little with ambient sound and I have moved it around the kitchen to get better responses.None of the Dots conflict with the other and setup for all were very easy.We have just started collecting Alexa enabled outlets and have started automating some lighting.  We have a Wemo and now a handful of TP Link to experiment with.  All fairly easy to install.I plan to purchase one more Dot for my garage workshop.

I'm not one on musical quality but I'd say its pretty good for what it does. And if you want to put it on your desk and you don't want to bother anyone with whatever you are having Alexa do for you (play music, read your ebook, read your twitter feed, etc) you can just plug your headphones in the back and all her outputs will come straight into your headphones.

However, when I want to listen to music over my stereo I have a amazonbasics Bluetooth setup with my home theater. When I disconnect Alexa from the Bluetooth, Alexa automatically reattaches to it in seconds.  I did a workaround by unplugging the Bluetooth receiver when I'm not using it. This seems to do the trick. However it would be nice when I tell Alexa to disconnect if I could totally disable Bluetooth in the Echo.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Democritus","Great, almost perfect, but needs work on functionality for questions and answer.","I have six of these and an Amazon Echo in my home, controlling Smart Things lights and other devices by voice. While she (I have taken to anthropomorphizing Alexa) does not understand many, if not most, queries, she operates home lighting like a champ.She is pretty good at being an alarm clock and timing cooking of food, as well as playing almost anything I could want for music.She usually gets simple things like looking up a phone number wrong, and usually responds with ""I don't think I know the answer to that question.""  I have done voice training and speak clearly, as the app tiles show. She understands the query, but cannot locate the answer.  This is basic for a cloud based assistant and should have been worked out by now.Still, I am happy with it.","February 18, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","svede","Fun for home automation, radio, shopping lists, timers, unit conversions, alarms, news and more","This is my third device in addition to my Echo and first Dot to expand my home automation system. They work quite well for that and as either a lower quality audio source for music, etc or streaming it via Bluetooth to my sound bar. We also use the larger Echo to play white noise in the bedroom at night to promote sleep. This could also be done with the Dot. My only nit is that the white Dot has a black face. Seeing as I am partnering the Dot with the white Dot protective case to hang on my wall the black face stands out too much. Would have preferred it and the cord also white.","March 14, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","S. R. Combs","Hidden Cost of Alexa","I love this little gadget however, it seems as though it's only good for streaming music, reading the news and reporting current weather, times and the like around the world unless you want to pay to play.  If you want music from a place other than Pandora or iHeart radio, you have to purchase Amazon Prime. If you want to use it to control other devices in your home, you have to purchase not only special wireless enabled light bulbs and switches to control these devices (which are VERY expensive at the moment) you also have to purchase a separate bridge to connect the devices to the Alexa app.So, if you want this little gadget to do all of the things as advertised, you are easily looking at spending another $200-$300 depending on how many things in your home you want her to control.","January 4, 2017"

There are still some questions which Alexa is not programed to answer (I suppose it has to do with which search engine answers are pulled).  However, my Echo Dot is wonderful.  Within minutes I was comfortable with her and my voice was easily recognized (repeatedly).  I enjoy the positive and supportive apps. I give it 5stars because it does just what I want it to do, when I want it to do it.  The Echo Dot has picked up my voice from across a master bedroom and she has picked up my gentle whisper in the morning. I am most pleased with how easy it is for me to put something on my calendar and to know it syncs with google calendar.  I plan on taking full advantage of the shopping and to-do-list as this will support me since I often forget what to do and get. I am amazed at how well it works, I foresee Amazon making even better strides with it. I have never used technology which provides responses and information as fast as it does.Since the Echo Dot doesn't work on battery it always has to be plugged in.  There is nothing it can do if the power is out. However, this is probably a suitable time to enjoy solitude anyway. Gratitude Amazon Engineers for this amazing and useful gadget.","December 28, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","P Hodge","echo dot 2 , wink hub 2, GE zwave switches","Paired echo dot 2 with wink hub 2 to control switches in house. Started out with two ge zwave switches, the echo and wink hub. The setup between the switches, hub and echo is just plain simple. I started by controlling my front and back LED floodlights just to make sure this stuff truly worked before spent $$$. The hub, echo and 2 switches will set you back about$220. But this setup is without a doubt AWESOME. The first test run with the switches , hub and echo went great. I can tell echo to turn off or on front and back floodlights or tell echo to turn all on or off as a group. I'm impressed and being an electrician by trade my mind is reeling with endless possibilities for this setup.

I have had Alexa play music, tell regular and knock knock jokes, tell me the local weather, played spelling games and black jack with ""her,"" set an alarm, tell me the news, and I sometimes talk to her when no one else is around.  Alexa is capable of many other tasks.  The Echo Dot has its own built in speakers, which I find adequate.  You can add a plug in speaker or bluetooth speaker if you want to.  I am extremely satisfied with the performance of the Echo Dot/Alexa, and highly recommend her to others.  I am going to purchase another one for my living area upstairs.  I am also going to purchase a couple for my adult kids as Christmas gifts.  If you are reading this review, you should buy one, you will be very pleased with ""her"" performance.","November 12, 2016"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Karen O.","Its ok","It was between Echo and Google Home, I went with Echo because of the price. Well, its ok and works with my Smart Things home automation hub. I have to say having to add skills is a bit annoying. The fact that a lot of your questions to Echo will be answered with ""hmm,  I don't know"" So if you are someone that wants to ask questions and have them answered without you having to go into the Alexa app to click on bing... then maybe this is not for you. Also when you connect Echo with speakers there are issues, but when it works well and is connected to your playlist its great. On the good side I can ask Echo to turn lights on and off and change the thermostat temp. So overall not bad. I wish I had a chance to compare with Google Home to see which one is actually better for my needs.","February 22, 2017"

At least it has volume buttons on the unit itself unlike the regular Echo. I'm sure later versions will come with a battery. Either way portability is limited to your Wi-Fi.

You can play music, radio, traffic reports, ask her to give you the definition of a word or even give you showtime listings at your local movie theatre!!! She learns every second of the day so that also helps tremendously. I currently have her in my bedroom right in front if my flat screen. I can be walking up the steps and give a command or ask a question and she can hear me! This morning I used her for an alarm clock lol.

But I can't. Something has recently screwed up the way Alexa responds, and I suspect it's on Amazon's end. Alexa is less able to answer questions than either Google or Siri, it consistently gets music selections wrong, can't find music or audiobooks that are in my library, and drops wi-fi unexpectedly and without cause. These problems are all recent, and seem to rise from a pushed update.It's nice to have the Echo Dot to extend the Echo's usefulness throughout the house.

I have the dot connected to my stereo, a higher mid-range Onkyo with a pair of restored McIntosh Xr5's, and the audio quality of music out of the 3.5mm jack is excellent.  You can tell that the audio is compressed a bit, but It's a solid not bad considering I can start it up without getting out of bed.

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Thomas Barnes","Android App Useless","Received an Echo Dot as a gift. The device itself works well, although I do wish there were more useful skills - there seems to be an infinite number of skills like fart sounds that have no use beyond juvenile humor. The real problem, however, is the smartphone app that is needed. On an Android phone with a solid 4G or high-speed WiFi connection, the app very frequently hangs on the start screen with the progress indicator turning but never initializes. It's nice to be able to update a shopping list by voice, but the poor app makes this an effectively useless feature when you can't access the list via the app when out shopping. The device appears to be well designed, but the app is a good example of lousy software engineering - no doubt done on the cheap. This makes the Echo Dot an interesting toy, but not reliable enough to be really useful.","January 31, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Auvy","A super inexpensive way to introduce add voice activation to smart home tools","I never thought I would buy an Echo, but I'm so glad I did.  Alexa is so fun to talk to and once you get in the habit of asking what the weather report is, or what's your commute is like, you'll wonder how you ever got by without her.  Yes, that's taking laziness to a new level since you can look it up, but on the other hand, it lets you multitask.  You can select from a growing library of skills to enable Alexa to do new things such as control certain kind of lights, or to trigger Logitech Harmony ""activities"" if you have a Logitech hub.  The speaker on the Dot is small -- if you have a bluetooth speaker you can pair it with the Dot.  The Dot also has a headphone jack so you can use a cord that has a headphone plug on each end to connect it to speaker that accepts that kind of connection.","November 21, 2016"

We've had one small issue with the speaker which I'm trying to correct now. The first night we paired the bluetooth speaker, we had music coming out of the Echo Dot and the speaker. After that first night, music only comes out of one or the other, not both simultaneously. I've unpaired and paired again, to no avail. Tech support doesn't seem to have heard of this before. They are replacing it free of charge. Other than this issue, we still love it! It's awesome. There are limits to what it can do, but it does most of what I want. I love to say, ""Alexa, set a timer for...."". Or, ""Alexa, play Pandora"". For parties it's really great because you can just skip a song if you want. It's easy to use the phone app as well. I'm getting more of these as X-mas gifts.","November 1, 2016"

Works exactly like the larger version with the only difference being the speaker.  The Dot has minimal speakers that are fine for communication with it but not great for music.

As a side note I use the name Echo for it and Alexa for the main one downstairs that way there is no confusion when I talk to it.","March 12, 2017"

She tells me the weather forecast every morning before I head out. In the evening she tells me the scores of my favorite sports teams. She has an immediate answer to just about any question that you can ask. I can't say enough good things about the Amazon Echo Dot.

One other annoying thing.  If you start a list on the Dot you cannot erase it simply by telling it to erase and start a new list. Again,  you have to log into the app and delete the list there.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","EMOlson","Approaching excellence... but not there yet!!  No SONOS!","My big problem with the Echo was that there was no way to connect to SONOS.  (I took off two stars for that.)The new DOT has the same issue, but I am only taking off one star.  The reason for that being when you Jerry-rig a connection using a BT reciever you loose the Echo or Dot speaker, which is a bigger deal for the Echo because you have paid $120 more for that speaker.So you can Jerry-rig a connection...  You have to buy a Bluetooth receiver, pair it to the Dot, connect it to the line-in on a Sonos Play, and then swithc your Sonos to ""line-in"".  Problem solved? ....Well, ""Yes"" and ""No""!There are still two major problems.  The first is that linking other Sonos zones doesn't work that well (Sonos is great but not designed for live streaming).  Which leads to the second issue (which is a minus 1 star for DOT); if one wants to hear Sonos in multiple rooms you have to link your zone to another input or zone (bypassing the DOT).  The problem here is that the DOT is still sending it's sound to the Play unit which is no longer listening.  Your Alexa is mute when connected to BT!The easy solution is to tell Alexa ""disconnect bluetooth""...  the problem is that the DOT immediately reconnects to bluetooth because BT receiver's are designed to auto-reconnect to previously paired devices.  This means you have to either ""forget"" the connection or unplug the BT receiver...... What a pain!TO THE DOT ENGINEERING TEAM: come on guys, you are getting so close!  First and best solution: GIVE US A SONOS SKILL.  I""LL GIVE YOU SIX STARS....  Short of that us a firmware upgrade for both Echo and Dot that allows us 1) the option to keep the speaker on when paired to BT and 2) to completely control DOT's BT by voice.... Disable the auto-reconnect feature in the DOT, it is not needed.  Do that and I will change to five stars.","November 12, 2016"

I do wish you were able to set the dot to know which room it is in, so I can say something like ""Turn the lights off"" when I'm in the family room, and since that dot is in the room it should know to only modify those lights.

Also, it doesn't work well in a noisy environments. You have to speak very loud,  even then, it doesn't understand you at times.Alexa, though, works well when ambient noise is at a minimum. The another thing that does well is voice commands in home automation. I have a home theater and implemented this along with Harmony Hub, Tplink, and Lutron Caseta dimmers.

There are other questions as well where it fails to understand what you're asking in ways that Google Now on Android phones seems to have no problems understanding.

I can say the same thing, at the same volume, in the same way, from the same distance and Alexa doesn't wake until the 3rd try--A LOT. That said, I love the smart home integration, a few of the skills (particularly Domino's Pizza), not having to grab my phone every time I want to know the time or a basic fact and, especially, using the Dot with Amazon Music Unlimited. My greatest desire in life, however, is that I be able to control a Fire TV Stick with the Dot. Yes, both devices have Alexa, but they don't play well together. Surely, a fix for this is underway.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Amanda","Awesome!!!!!","I haven't been this excited about a tech gadget in awhile. I had high expectations for this gadget and that is what it's delivered and then some. At home I don't have a real assistant and my son refuses to read a book to me or set my alarm or turn on my Spotify so I've adopted Alexa:) It's a pretty great device, it does all that is stated in advertising and much more. I have been able to listen to audio books, command a playlist to open on spotify to play instantly with the ability to control the volume on command. I have set it to brief me on current events and news, I use it daily to set morning wake alarms and timers when I'm cooking and I can ask for cooking recipes and cocktail recipes. It will give me the game times and scores for my favorite teams, it tells me what traffic is like before I head to work, and just for fun I have connected it with my Firestick and it can pause when I need to take a break and resume when I return. And last but not least I currently own only one type of smart home device which is the TP-Link plug which I've connected to a lamp and it's just awesome to have the ability to turn a light on by voice command when I enter a room and before I go to bed. Very cool technology, I highly recommend this awesome little gadget. P.S. for the reviewers who hate it you probably need help setting it up. And I've helped set up 10 Echo Dots now and when it doesn't connect to the internet you either need to reset and start over or there is a problem with your internet. For the guy who said it doesn't turn on his tv, the description doesn't claim that the dot has that capability but the harmony hub should help:)","October 27, 2016"

I like its ability to connect to external speakers, even more so since the sound from the Dot is tinny and not music worthy.

It is a good distance from the router, but my iPad has no problem with maintaining its connection from the room.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","David B.","Great unit with some drawbacks.","Although this unit does have a speaker, it was definitely designed for hooking up to an external audio system.  To that end Amazon should spend a bit more time and budget focusing on the output quality of the device through the mini jack.  One of the biggest selling points of the device is streaming amazon music through it.  The output through the mini jack is so low even at maximum volume you have to run it through a preamp before sending it to the regular amplifier or reciever.  Also a ""audiophile"" version that had digital outs or at least decent/replaceable DACs would be super helpful even if this version cost substantially more.  The other option would to be to include these features on the full sized echo but nothing exists there either.","January 30, 2017"

I have now had the Echo Dot for a couple of months and I must say that I love it. It has become a part of my life. I have it hooked up to switch on my lights and I love the home integration. If you buy the Echo Dot, get some TP link plugs too. I was surprised at how good the speaker is on the Dot. Not bad at all!

The only weird thing that happened recently was it randomly at about 10 to 6AM announced it was now paired to my tablet device without me pairing the device!  Other then that odd instance I have had no issues no problems and no complaints! It is small, but for me the right size to be placed in one of the rooms, as I did as well purchase the Echo itself!

But the error message when it cannot connect is not very helpful.It says ""I'm having trouble understanding right now.  Try again later"".  But I found that this is caused because it can't connect to the Amazon servers.  So far in my case for whatever reason it sometimes fails to connect to my WiFi on initial power up and I may have to power cycle the Dot 2 or more times before it connects.  Of course it could also have an issue where it connects to the WiFi and cannot reach the Amazon servers.It would be better it the error message indicated the actual problem.  That is ""I cannot connect to WiFi""  or ""I cannot connect to the servers"".That would help to determine where the problem might be.So I knocked off a star for that.","October 26, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Genielle","Wished it used Google instead of Bing, but still great","I received this as a Christmas gift. Was fascinated with this at first, but it doesn't use Google.

Typed the same question into Google & got the answer at the very top of the page. I like the echo dot for simple things, but I guess I can't be truly lazy & will still have to Google some things. Microphone & speakers on the echo dot are great. I would definitely give this as a gift to someone. I also like that you can play simple games with Alexa like 20 questions.

I mostly use it for music (the Amazon library is pretty respectable), radio, timers, weather, and turning on the lights in my home.  The ""skills"" (third party abilities that you can teach Alexa to recognize) are a bit lack luster.  Many of them are novel, boutique, or overly specific.  It's definitely worth adding that the mic array is impressive.  I have been blasting heavy metal music through my house and successfully ""summoned"" Alexa from 20 feet away in another room.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Les Martin","A great way to get the functionality you want without spending a lot!","My wife hated the idea of the Echo.  After seeing this at a couple of people's houses I was sold.  I have a very nice but old Bose Wave Radio in my kitchen so I really didn't need the full blown Echo and I didn't want to spend that much money.  When it arrived and I began using it and my wife was not happy.  After I showed her how to add things to the shopping list and play music she began to come around.  We now use the Echo Dot and app to manage our weekly grocery list.  I even come home to find her using the Dot to play music.  Next I need to sell her on the idea of connected bulbs, switches and outlets.  Asking for forgiveness is probably the best policy.This device is a great way to get the functionality you want without spending a lot.  I have had relatively few issues with the device.  I held off for a while but since I started pairing my Dot with my iPhone 6 Plus I have found yet another use.  I can play podcasts without the clunky process via voice commands and TuneIn.  It's even simple to disconnect from the device just using a verbal command which then allows me to move to another area of the house and connect to a different speaker.I plan to buy more of these if and when I expand my use of them.  The media room seems to be the next room in need of an Echo.","March 1, 2017"

The technology is amazing though, and has great potential.  Now, if they really wanted to sell lots of these I would recommend making a version that expanded on the quips making it more AI like.Pros:  Same functionality as found it the larger echo but takes up less space.  Price is less than 1/2 of the echo.  Has Bluetooth capability.  Is updatable and I'm sure the capability will be expanded on in the future.  In my opinion, the best voice recognition service out there so far.Cons (struggled to quantify these):  The novelty of Alexa quickly runs out after about 30 minutes.  I just didn't use it so it became just another device taking up bandwidth and bringing my network down with updates.Summary:  A comparatively inexpensive voice activated updatable paperweight with great potential.

This is one of the best products that I have ever purchased from Amazon and will be a game changer in households worldwide. It is affordable and the design is sleek and simple. The only downside I would say about this product is that in order to completely maximize the use for Alexa, a smart house system is needed. However, as a standalone device, Alexa is still very helpful and amazing. You can even talk to it like Siri on your iPhone. Have fun!","January 1, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","DJ","Love the Dot","Amazon's Echo products are fantastic! Started out with the Tap and then got the Dot in our family room. Plugged it into the AV system in the family room and was ready to go in the blink of an eye. It's small and unobtrusive and dead simple to set up. The microphones work really well, able to hear the commands from across the room (except when we've had big groups over and there's a lot of background noise). We really like being able to get the weather forecast or news in morning, playing music on the stereo system when friends are over or listening to audiobooks on Audible. We love it because every one in the house can use it and guests too. Bet it would be even more handy if we had some smart home devices connected. Highly recommended","January 26, 2017"

I use her all the time. My grocery list is now kept with Alexa, she keeps tabs on all of our food timers, I paired her with my light switches invade my hands are full and I need the lights turned on. We also use her to stream music while we cook. And in the spring she will get connected to a home wide audio system.One down side and it's not something I would take a star away for. She isn't contextual so she doesn't build off the last question. You must give all the info needed in the question you are asking. My understanding is that the google one is more like having a conversation with a person.","February 5, 2017"

Voice recognition is from my point of view very good. I can't compare with the Echo like others have done but I can compare with Apple TV and as a non native English speaker my wife and I always thought our pronunciation is not precise enough but now recognizing that Alexa understands what Siri didn't understood shows from my point of view that voice recognition of Alexa is better than the Siri one (at least in our 'conversations' we had so far with the two systems).

TuneIn told me this was a ""known issue.""  Audible.com books will play, but you can' access audible subscriptions like the New York Times.  And Audible is an Amazon company!

As soon as we move into the city and I know that I will be having a stronger internet, you can bet that I will be purchasig them again.  The only bad thing about it (if you consider bad) was that if it hears it's name on the tv it will try to answer. I found this out when I was woken up around 1 am.  Just a minor glitch.

The sound is sensational.The Dot (always Bluetooth connected to our wholehouse sound system) is now the household primary Amazon device located near the kitchen (the remote has been switched over to it from the Echo) and the Echo has been moved to the bedroom (providing awesome independent sound through its 9 bulit-in speakers).Why knock off a Star?

This requires you to remember very specific commands to do certain things.

The Dot itself works wonderfully. I plan to continue to do some home automation as I go. I do think it would have easily been worth the money simply as a way to voice control my music.

The speaker on the Dot isn't as good as on the Echo, but honestly we didn't know what we were missing until we got the full sized Echo. :) It's perfect for a small room. My only complaint is that the Dot doesn't pick up my voice very well when the alarm is going off. It actually sometimes doesn't pick up my husband's either, but he has better luck.

It is nice to ask her to play some music when you come home from school, and start listening to tunes before your bag hits the floor. I have had some issues with her understanding my speech every once in a while, but she tends to be pretty accurate. besides the rare bugs with connectivity (90 percent of my interactions with alexa is for pandora, so its frustrating when she says she cant access my tunes)  she is mostly faultless, and has become my favorite and most used part of my room.

Alexa is pretty limited when it comes to questions but it's good if you want to listen to music and order stuff. I don't like that the volume only goes up to 10 (which isn't that loud) so you still have to buy bluetooth speakers if you liek to blast your music and I HATE that you can only use it while it's plugged into the charger! You have to get a portable charger in order to use it around the house smh I don't understand why it's like this. But I guess that's what you get for $50 and I guess it's limited because it's tiny.

I love the size, color and that it's super easy to set up and use.There is occasional confusion between the two Echos (I ended up changing the wake word for one), and sometimes it responds to my tv (""Alex and Mary may..."" was interpreted as ""Alexa, marry me"" and ""Diet coke please"" was interpreted as ""Echo, please"").

We use it all the time, mostly for playing music in the kitchen, and also for setting timers, checking the weather and answering questions. The Dot has all of the same technology but with an incredibly crappy speaker. Sure, you can connect it to an external speaker via Bluetooth or wired connection but honestly you may as well just buy a regular Echo. There are compact Bluetooth speakers on the market with far better sound than the Dot. I don't know why it's so poor.Perhaps the biggest disappointment with the Dot is that even if you put these in every room of your house as Amazon wants you to do, they don't talk to each other. It's a reasonable expectation that if I'm playing music on one Echo device, I would have the option of simultaneously playing it on the other devices in my home, like a Sonos system. But they operate independently although they are all on the same network.My advice: Skip the Dot. If you want another Echo, spend the extra money and get a real one.","April 15, 2017"

An important use will also be to get instant answers that young students ask throughout the day. I am looking forward to exploring other uses for this fantastic product.

I warn you, however, that what might begin as a novelty purchase will soon become a necessary and useful addition to your home! I simply call out what I need at the store and it's recorded for me. I can make a to-do list like this, as well. I can check the weather while getting dressed, so I know how many layers to wear, look up ingredients, substitutions,recipes, and even meal ideas while standing in the kitchen with my hands full! She's a calculator, spell-checker, news broadcast, shopping directory, history lesson, game opponent, dictionary, encyclopedia, music channel, timer, alarm clock, movie guide, personal assistant, book-reader, wellness coach, sports authority and trivia master... and lots more! Dot is blue tooth enabled, so you can hook up your own speaker.( Dot is as loud as an alarm clock on her own) I have purchased several compatible smart plugs and switches when on sale, and my units operate some of my lighting, which is more handy than I ever imagined it could be- like when I get up at 3am and want to see where I am going.My Amazon AI units make my life easier!","December 1, 2016"

I just wish they could talk to each other so I could play music in the whole house using voice commands, rather than just on the single Dot processing my voice commands.A work-around I've found is to use an external speaker (e.g. a DKNight MagicBox II, Anker A3143 or Bose Soundlink mini) in addition to a Google Chromecast audio device with each external speaker.  I share the external speaker with both the Chromecast audio and the Echo Dot, using a passive stereo mixer like the $30 (used) ART SplitMix4.  I can send music simultaneously to all of them via wifi, and still use the external speaker in each room connected to the Echo Dots.","January 21, 2017"

We spent NYE taking turns requesting songs.  We have not yet hooked it up to a speaker.  The one that came with it is decent if you are in the same room but you would want something better if you were listening to music in a larger area.

Oftentimes direct questions don't work, either.  E.g., Echo, ""what is the most popular dog breed"" yielded a response of, ""I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.""  I didn't think that to be too unique, or obscure, a question.  I Did get the answer to ""who's the tallest man in the world?""I'll continue to use the cards to train the device.

If you ask for a flash briefing on one, you leave the room and the other one is not giving the flash briefing simultaneously. However, to do list, shopping list, and calendar are all connected (through the app, which is like a Cloud server). I wish it was an option to have Echo products throughout the home connect.

I am returning this product tomorrow and am no longer interested in the Echo.  I'm going to try Google's version of this product and see if I have better luck with them.That was two weeks of mild entertainment.Original post below:This product is very limited on its capabilities and has difficulty understanding base commands.  It also struggles to find the appropriate song on a consistent basis.  Sometimes the product responds with inappropriate comments.  It is highly frustrating and I find it more convenient to use my cell phone to look up information or listen to music.  I regret being an early adopter of this product and find very little use for it other than setting alarms for cooking or as a paperweight.I love Amazon and am a Prime member, but in my opinion they have far from excelled with this technology.","March 5, 2017"

I also use this to control my LIFX light, and that works pretty well too! One thing on this is, it is limited on the commands for the LIFX, and this has to do with the limitations from the bulb, not the echo itself.

The advantage of the Dot is that I can easily connect with bluetooth headphones so that I can listen to audible books without competing with the TV nearby.  (The advantage of the Tap is that it is portable). While the Echo has the best speaker of the three options,  I am thinking the Dot, being tiny and having bluetooth advantages may be the best of the 3, especially for the money.

There are many apps (called skills) to use with Alexa, but I'm not sure how to organize and remember all the apps I have enabled, as there is no visual list to remind me what is available. So, if you don't use the skill on a regular basis, you will probably forget that it is available and forget how to call it up by voice command.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Robert Giuffrida","Meh.","Initially, I thought this might connect to my Alexa tower to expand the voice listening and music output capabilities.  While it's great for listening, the two DO NOT sync and play the same music at the same time, so this will not expand your music output.  Additionally, the speaker on this sounds like a phone speaker.  That's it.  Compared to the original, which has rich sound for its size, this sounds really cheap.I was considering returning this but I may find use for it in another room, possibly connected to a stereo system for better sound output.  All in all, if you're looking for good sound, don't waste your money with this.  You'll end up spending just as much on this and a really good bluetooth speaker system as you would on the original Alexa tower.  A bit disappointing but maybe Amazon will eventually allow dots to sync together in this manner.","March 8, 2017"

And, I couldn't be more thrilled. I knew it was going to be great, but I was blown away with all the features. Amazon music on the Echo Dot is life changing. I can listen to over a million songs, just with simple voice commands. The alarm feature is super helpful. I use it as a timer for cooking or a wake up from a fast power nap. I never have to worry about missing another event in my calander on days off. Anything I can think of it has an anwer for. I love how it shows all of my questions on the app as well. This truly has made my life so much easier!!","December 31, 2016"

I have a huge list of improvements they could make, but they probably will as they are all software issues not hardware problems. I am kinda dumbfounded as to why they haven't dine some simple things like different voices, stacking commands.. Surely that will come. If they put a new version out that does that stuff..it will only be because of the software in the servers. THEY WILL LOSE ME AS A CUSTOMER IF THEY PULL THAT. This has all it needs to do anything voice connected already. If they go ""Apple""..they can go the Apple route. For now, I like them.","January 2, 2017"

I have prime membership so asked Alexa to play songs and also tried few basic questions like weather etc. The response is instantaneous and is amazing. I am so far getting a big kick out of quick responses from alexa and I think I will keep it :)As many reviewers mentioned connecting to an external speaker provides better quality of sound. The built in speaker is not bad either. I tried both ways and I like it both.","December 3, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","MICHAEL GDULA","Relevant and reliable voice control.","Bought a 6 pack for Cristmas gifts. Of course, 1 was for me. Everyone that got one loves her. Even quickly earned my own wife acceptance factor. One regret is that compatible battery packs cost as much as the appliance. Wish the IFTT development were as easy as Arduino, not being a real developer and all that. Having done some r&d in the 70's on home automation, this is an awesome appliance. Looking for cost push to overcome some of the more quickly integratable peripherals to come about. $200 thermostats are a rip. I forecast a $20 bass boost/ battery cylinder (or another unique shape) that Dot sits on top of - or recessed into - will sell gazillions.Enjoy yours, YMMV.","January 13, 2017"

Downloaded the free app for my android phone and setup the device to my location so when I ask it what tomorrow's forecast is it gets the right city. The app is easy to use and I was configured in no time. This device is only going to get better with time too as Amazon seems to update this little machine often.

When the price dropped to $39.99. I decided to take the leap and I bought two of them (One for a gift). I've never looked back. This is a stand alone unit that appears to be exactly the same as the ECHO on top, but lacks the bass speaker on the bottom. However, you can hook it up to a sound system for even better sound than the EXHO. It reaches out to the cloud for info, so it is very informative as a result...weather, traffic, time, definitions, jokes and it's abilities are being added all the time.

I like that it will connect to my Pandora and iHeart radio, and it will help the kids with spelling and math. You have to be very specific with your questions/requests and not speak fast (like my daughter does) to get an answer from Alexa.

Setting calendar alerts and playing jeopardy are also among my daily tasks with Alexa. Spotify functionality is mediocre and many of Amazon's services such as prime music are also hard to work with, but I've found things to improve over time as updates roll in, and I really won't give any in depth complaints simply because the price was so low and the value so good.","February 22, 2017"

I guess if your house is all all digitized and you want to control lights and stuff the Dot may be more useful, but I'm not about to spend lots of money for an electronic light switch and my thermostat is already programmed.

Again, mostly for NPR and weather reports and as an alarm clock.

I found that to get it (her) to play the entire symphony in correct movement order, I need to say ""Alexa, play THE ALBUM Beethoven's Fifth Symphony"". I found this out by accident, in a response to some support question somewhere, but I haven't seen this documented anywhere.

When comparing it to the google SI I lean more towards google, however I own the Dot and not the google SI and also I spent a third of the price.

My only gripe with this device is it's strange tendinces when asking questions, it can answer what is overwatch. But it dosen't know what battlefield is, a strange occurrence. This item is also great with family members as everyone can have an echo dot in their rooms and, have a full amazon echo on the main floor. They are also indipendent meaning you don't have to have the full echo to use the dot. One recommendation I would make is to use a external speaker, the internal one is pretty weak. With this product amazon has shown that is a major contender in the home automation field, and has also shown that they can create a product ecosystem that can combine or be completely indipendent, a truly amazing feat.","November 23, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","David Budden","Easy to operate and fun to use","Bought this for my wife as a birthday gift and we have been enjoying it since.  Easy to operate and fun to use.  Added apps to control smart plugs and thermostats and although the apps could be improved, the Echo Dot performs what is available.  (Hopefully the apps will be updated to allow Alexa to perform more functions.)  I have not owned or heard the original Echo and based on the size, I would assume the sound quality to be superior to the Dot, but even with the smaller speaker, the Dot sound quality is very good.  It is fine when using for background music.  If I want better sound quality, I simply pair with the OOntZ Angle 2 Plus portable Bluetooth speaker.","February 9, 2017"

Time Capsule is hands down the only way to go when it comes to wifiing your house. And every single wifi item in my house now works. And work fantastic.But this little dot is fun and fantastic. I'll be back for more. I love gadgets. And I really love gadgets that WORK. And work well. This is the best $50 bucks I have spent in a long time.","January 21, 2017"

Unbelievable how you can communicate with Alexa and she even understands what you say.Speak to her from another room and she understands what you say.  She is extremely fast returning your answer.  Great for music of your choice, creating a shopping list, creating a to do list, answers just about any question, tells you the weather wherever you like, etc.Haven't gotten into the turning lights or equipment on and off yet.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Phillip","Overall I like it","I bought this unit for my mother as she had used my echo while visiting my house.  I gave it only a 4 stars for the same reasons I gave the echo 4 stars which was mainly for a lack of some software features that might come out eventually.  The biggest difference between the two is the speaker quality as the sound from this unit is extremely tinny so if you are planning to use the echo to listen to music I would either get the echo or purchase a Bluetooth speaker to pair with this unit for better sound quality.  But for the price this is a much better option for the echo if you don't care about the sound quality as all the same things the echo can do this can too!","December 27, 2016"

I'm glad I did as this one is about $40 less expensive than the first gen model with only minor tweaks in functionality. It works as well as my main ""tower"" Echo, and it's great to have Alexa bedside to turn on and off the lights and set the thermostat temperature on my Sensi. I think I need one or two more for some other rooms...","October 28, 2016"

I will have to do some research to make it more useful.  So far it serves as an alarm or timer.  It gives me a weather report.  It reads my audible books by verbal command.  It plays my amazon music, or iHeart music.It is silly, the news update has a female voice and Alexa will sometimes hear an ad on itself and respond with ""I didn't get that"".  Oh and a silly joke each day.  But in all a fun way to be able to up cleaning, exercising and have news, weather, and music.  I have enjoyed listening to music by era's.

Alexa does not alert you about your reminders.Example: ""Alexa, remind me to feed fish at 1pm"" ""ok, I will remind you to feed fish at 1pm"" except at 1pm alexa does not alert you. If you ask her ""Alexa, what do I have to do today?"" She will say ""Feed the fish at 1pm"" but if you don't ask she will not alert you.This seems strange because she can set an alarm for a specific time, or start a timer. So why not alarm on reminders?","December 24, 2016"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Scott L.","4 month review","For the first 3 months, this was a fantastic device. Small issues here and there but nothing that took away from what it was designed to do. The whole family was using the device, mostly for music but timers and questions were abundant too. Now we are 4 months later and the device is being used less since you must YELL at it to function and if this tech device had an IQ it would be progressively dropping.  I jumped on my account to send it back to amazon for a possible fix. Sadly  there is only a 90-day warranty, good timing if you ask me.So would I recommend this product; I am on the fence, if spending $50 for a product that changes significantly from when first purchased is no big deal, then go for it.Also note our device has been set in one spot with extremely limited contact due to the voice driven system.","April 11, 2017"

It's a pain to have to constantly reconnect it to the Bose bluetooth, just cut out the middlman and use the iPhone which syncs automatically.

Love the news read out and the weather feature and its been very nifty for setting timers so I don't overcook stuff in the oven. However, Alexa activates whenever she thinks she hears her name.

As for limitations, there's stuff like: you can only stream Spotify by request from the primary account's associated Spotify account. I learned this after switching to them because Amazon music only works on ONE echo, not all of the echoes in the house. I hardly use Alexa anymore. My only use for it is to stream Spotify via Spotify Connect to the speakers I plugged into it in my office.

Yes, you can use the Tap as a bluetooth speaker for the Dot.  It works perfectly, I just say connect, and the Dot will connect to my Tap, (and the original setup was very easy.)  I find that the Dot is more sensitive than my Echo, who may becoming hard of hearing? I will say ""Alexa"" in the same room as the Echo and my Dot will hear it in the other room.  At this price its well worth the money, especially before Christmas when it was only $39!","January 27, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Petter","Really nice to have","So I was skeptical at first, but then once I got it in the house and started adding skills to it, it is quite useful.Every morning when I get up, I ask Alexa what is in the news, and I get my news briefing from the sources I configured.Also very useful if you have kids who are sharing something, and they can each set a timer for x amount of minutes to make sure they share properly and no fighting. I set my wake up alarm for the morning. We play some of the games available via the skills section, and I have started looking at home automation for which it seems to be perfect for as a voice interface to a controller.

Siri can help with a lot more right now.When you pause on an Amazon Music Playlist and then come back a few hours later and resume playing it starts the whole playlist over from the beginning rather than picking up where you paused it which is idiotic.The white Echo Dot should come with a white power cord.","December 28, 2016"

They both perform exactly the same.  However ...All the goodness of Echo/Alexa functionality is there, but voice responsiveness is sub-par when compared to the Dot version 1.  It very much appears that some technological corners were cut on version 2, as it now consistently takes two or three attempts to get Alexa's attention. The version 1 Alexa responds on the first try, every time. It's not about Alexa training, location, voice volume or my network latency.  It is about less sensitivity in the new Dot's microphones and/or circuitry.  It's a bother and certainly frustrating, but not a deal buster.","November 23, 2016"

This was a big step up from the first generation.However they seemed to make the aesthetic quality lower in order to make up for cost effectiveness. The top no longer has a turning dial style volume control. You have to press + or - to lower the volume physically. You can still use your voice to set the volume.This also does not come with the wire attachment for speakers so if you aren't using bluetooth you will need that.","January 24, 2017"

I'm presuming the positives are well reviewed elsewhere but the negative for me is about Alexa's capabilities in the kitchen. I primarily use my Echo for timing my cooking/baking. There is no way to tell Alexa to set the timer for the bread or broccoli. It's just ""set timer"" and then the Echo sounds the alarm when your timer is done. But if you have three timers set, and then the alarm goes off, you don't know what that timer was for. It's quite frustrating. This model needs an upgrade in this department. I don't regret the purchase but there needs to be some improvements.","January 15, 2017"

I ordered an extra one for travel so i can take it with me and get it to play my music and wake me up, but the timezone is fixed to my Amazon account so ""Alexa, wake me up at 9am"" will wake me up at some unearthly hour when i've got it sitting next to my bedside in Singapore or Dubai or London.

I felt the speaker was not really adequate and was of poor sound quality. This Dot provides all the functionality along with the option of adding better speakers. Sound from the unit is okay for voice responses but needs added speakers, with amplification, to reach its true potential.UPDATE: I think I found the perfect speakers. The Edifier R1700BT are dual powered speakers. They utilize either Bluetooth or can be hard-wired. They came with all the right cables to connect to the Dot. They look beautiful and sound even better. I read that hard-wired provides a better sound. They run about $150.","October 28, 2016"

Up front I will say that I have purchased the original Echo, the Echo Dot, v1 and the Echo Dot, v2.  I love the idea of the product, but the quality of the Dot 2 is not good.  My original Echo (purchased 11/3/15) and the Dot 1 (purchased 3/3/16) are working fine.  They come with a 1 year warranty. The Dot 2 come with a 90 day warranty.  There is a reason for that - the Dot 2 is a piece of crap.  They lowered the price and the quality of the product.  The Dot 2 (purchased 9/18/16) died on 3/3/17, less than six months in use.  It was never dropped or abused in any way.  One day it simply said it had trouble connecting to the internet; I tried to reconnect it, but it consistently failed.  I got hold of tech support and have spent hours, literally, on the phone with them and they have not been able to get it to work either.  The error code (73441), they say they can't find in their manual. Because it is out of warranty I now own a worthless piece of junk.  Beware.","March 15, 2017"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Saki López","Mixed Feelings","As per the title I have mixed feelings on this.  My wife got this for me to try to help me with my ADD.  With just a few small modifications this could potentially be life changing for me.  One of my biggest problems tends to be getting caught up with things and forgetting to do things that need to be done.  So the obvious thing would be ask alexa to remind me to do things.  Unfortunately, she can't do that.  If i ask her to remind me to do something she just adds it to  a to do list, which i suppose i'm suppose to remember to ask her about.  That obviously defeats the entire purpose.  If i could remember to ask about it, i wouldn't need alexa to remind me about it in the first place.  I also can't seem to get her to snooze when the alarm goes off, which is mildly annoying.  You should also be able to tell her or set it in app how long you'd like to snooze.  Sometimes you might only want a 5 min snooze or even a 1 or 2 minutes snooze.  perhaps set up a nag feature where she will periodically nag you until you tell her to stop.  There might be a skill for that, but i'm not aware of it if there is.She can add appointments now to google calander, but unfortunately, as above, she can't be bothered to tell you about it unless you ask her.  You can train yourself to ask her for a daily briefing or multi daily briefing if that is all you want or need.  sadly for me that just isn't enough.  aside from not  being able to snooze alarms, the alarms work well.  to snooze i've been stopping her and setting a new alarm for my desired snooze time.  I just wish this either worked right as i know there is a snooze feature and/or was already built in for the snooze repeat time.She's great for playing music, though if you want to play specific songs you need to pre-upload them to your amazon account  (there is a file limit if you don't pay) or pay for an app that will do it like spotify or amazon music.  else you'll have to settle for free radio apps like pandora or spotify in radio mode.  it would be nice if it could play audio streams from youtube or other similar site.So for a voice controlled speaker it's pretty good, but as an assistant it still has a  bit of a way to go.","January 7, 2017"

She doesn't always get that perfectly, but close enough to recognize. I had a NASPI meeting that Alexa registered as an ASCII meeting (close enough for me). She also entered that meeting on my Google Calendar.New functions are being created all the time. Look for the sales for $40 (I paid $50 for mine).","December 19, 2016"

If Apple came out with their own version of Echo Dot, it would be very comprehensive.I like this product mostly because it is clever and convenient.

I can connect it to my speakers and it works perfectly. The sounds by itself is not bad (not stereo quality), almost the quality of a cell phone.

I found myself continuing to use the phone to play audio.I was actually trying to return it but waited too long and now I'm out of the return window.Unless you're looking to have Alexa do stuff for you - that you can't already do with your phone - it's not worth the $50.","April 4, 2017"

I have it connected to a small amplifier and a couple of speakers. Even Alexa sounds very good over the speakers. For the (much) lower price, I don't mind to have to connect the Dot to external speakers, especially because it's also much easier to ""hide"" than the standard Echo.Chances are that I will be back soon to order another Dot.","November 22, 2016"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","T. Martyny","Parental Advisory","PARENT WARNING:You can not filter songs with explicit lyrics for this device and ""Alexa Play"" picks up where you left off. This is a big problem for families with younger kids. My teenager listened to an explicit song one night and stopped it in the middle, then my 5 yo walked up the next morning and said ""Alexa play""...  There is no way to prevent this via settings, so make sure you are aware and talk to your kids before using the device. I assumed there wouldn't be songs with explicit lyrics available for my son to play via Amazon Prime and didn't know it would pick up where he left off if he played them.I also bought this device thinking it could give verbal reminders at given times, but it can't. It adds it to your reminders list and you have to ask it to tell you what's on your reminders. The main reason I bought it was for verbal timed reminders.It is nice/novel, but as a parent it's not what I needed and has introduced some new parenting challenges that I'm not sure are worth it.","October 26, 2016"

It is a lot of fun and saves time with things like to do lists, calendar entries, alarm clock set up and great for audio books or linking music or podcasts to bluetooth speakers.  Look into the IFTTT apps and read the manual for extra features if you are apt to play with tech stuff.  If not you dont have to be a techie, it is easy to set up and use.","December 5, 2016"

My 3 year old tries to control it too but luckily Echo doesn't understand him even through he's pretty clear for a kid. I use it with a Bluetooth speaker for playing Pandora in another room.

I really like the quick calculations for the kitchen especially.  There is nothing worse than trying to figure out how much to use and your hands are covered in food and you cannot get to your phone.

If it doesn't error up doing that, Alexa would directly tell me there's an error that occurred. When she gets like this, her speech is lagged and can't even respond on a full sentence. It's as if the beginning of the sentence is missing.Every time I interact with Alexa, she would take a substantial amount of time to ""think"" compared to the full sized Echo.

At first it seemed as though Alexa was going to be a useless and redundant app/item used as a make shift and copy of Siri. But as i began using the echo dot, my needs also began to expand. suddenly i found myself doing more with the device for example: i wake up every single day and say alexa inspire me today, and like that i get the motivation i need in the morning;  before going to bed, and don't judge, i ask alexa to read me a bed time story. as minimal as this seems it is it fulfills most of my needs for now and i cannot wait to make my home a smarter home.","January 12, 2017"

I even have one in my work shop that controls lights and seconds as a Bluetooth speaker.  I'm sold on the echo.  I'll be adding a couple more soon.  I caught my wife thanking Alexa last night.

Would be nice if we could ask other questions for web searches.  If Amazon ever expands to Canada my wife and I figure we will need five of them.  So Amazon, get your butt in gear.  With Netflix we can use it in Canada and the US.  So we should be able to use our Amazon Prime in both countries - either that or only charge for the USA Prime for the time we are in the US and then do that for the Canadian Prime.  Then you will realize why you should follow Netflix.","December 3, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","JimBob","Great addition","Have had the big Echo for almost a year which is in our living room and the Dot just arrived a few days ago and we placed it in our bedroom.  Paired it to our Bose Sound Link with no trouble.  The Dot speaker by itself is ok for news, weather, and alarms but for music you really need it paired via Bluetooth to a good speaker.  Our bedroom is fairly large and Dot has no problem hearing and responding from anywhere in  the room.  It's rare for ""Alexa"" to not hear a command.  While the skills are always increasing, I find only a few to be meaningful to us.  We love our Echos!  Will be buying some for Christmas gifts.","October 24, 2016"

If you have a friend or family member who is visually impaired/legally blind, or even just an elderly family member looking to stay in touch with the world, but doesn't have the patience to learn a computer or tablet, buy them one of these.

For example, if we need something from the store, but don't have time to write it down we just tell Alexa to add our item to the shopping list.  This is very convenient because all of the items added are readily available on the app that should be downloaded after getting the echo dot set up.  This is also a neat device because if you have Spotify or any other music app it works great so if I'm doing housework I don't have to mess with any remotes or anything.

It's a great item if you don't care to have it plugged in all the time. I love the compact size as it does not take up a lot of room. This is currently in my bedroom and I found the voice sensitivity to be great from across the room. This is my first voice command product so I don't have anything else to compare it to.

Running the app on a Kindle Fire, app locks up, and will only start after rebooting the Kindle. All in all this is a huge disappointment. Considering this is an Amazon device I am very disappointed and would not recommend getting an Echo/Echo dot and hoping it will be a good experience working with other Amazon devices. It's ironic that on an non Amazon tablet/phone the Alexa app works well. Sorry Amazon, this tells me your focus on development for your tablets is poor.","January 18, 2017"

If you plus the Dot into a stereo or home entertainment system with a wire (old school), you have to turn the source to that input to hear what Alexa tells you.  If I'm watching TV I'll never hear Alexa unless I change to the other source.  It would be nice if voice responses from Alexa would play through the Dot speaker and music would play through the external source.Other than that, setup is easy and the darn thing is great.

It was very bright and always looked like something was in the backround.

They can also get new applications which give them more capabilities. I have a z-wave hub interfaced to them to send me alerts if there starts to be a flood in the house. They play music nicely.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Eric H.","The most versatile Alexa option","I was skeptical about the usefulness of Alexa, but I'm a believer now.  I first purchased an Amazon Tap for my wife because I wanted her to be able to take it with her wherever she went in the house and this was the only available portable ""Alexa"" option.  I quickly learned two things.  First was that Alexa is really cool and quite useful.  Second is that having to tap a button to wake up Alexa is annoying.  I immediately wanted to make a move to an ""always on"" Alexa device.  This left me with two choices, the Echo and the Dot.  The Echo is the easy choice, but it didn't make sense to me to get the Echo because it is basically a Dot with a nice built in speaker.  For the price difference between the two, I could get the Dot and pair it with a great quality Bluetooth (or wired) speaker.  It just gives you a lot more options, including being able to wire it directly into a home stereo system.Configuring:The Dot is extremely easy to set up through the Alexa app on your phone.  You can be up and running within a couple minutes after you go through the simple set up program and get it connected to your WiFi.  The Echo, after configuring and connecting to WiFi, runs entirely in the Amazon cloud.  This means that it does not run through your phone, but rather runs off internet based programming and only needs to be connected to WiFi.  Your phone is only used to give access to certain cloud based programs and ""skills"".  After that, it runs independently, but may send info back to your phone.  Overall, it is very easy and intuitive.Usefulness:I seem to find new uses for the Dot every day.  Like most people, my primary use is for music.  I have it connected to Amazon Music, Pandora, Spotify, iHeart Radio and TuneIn.  You can be very vague and just ask for a genre of music or you can ask for a specific title via a specific music service.  I listen to a wide variety of music and whether it is rock, metal, rap, country, jazz or classical I have always been able to find what I wanted to listen to with Alexa.Outside of music, I use Alexa to control my thermostat, turn lights on/off, lock the door, check weather, check calendar, get news updates, sports scores, order pizza and even play some fun interactive games with Alexa.  Amazon offers a huge variety of ""skills"" that can be enabled on your Dot and that list continues to grow as more companies offer these interactive options which are similar to apps for your smartphone.Ease of use:One Dot can cover a large size room for voice recognition pretty well.  The only time that I have had an issue is when it is placed too close to the speaker and it is trying to hear me over the music.  I have purchased multiple units and have them throughout the house.  I also have one that I put in my office at work. I'm constantly amazed at how accurate it is at understanding what I am saying.  It very rarely has trouble understanding me.Conclusion:It is hard for me to imagine not having this very useful item around now that I have become accustomed to it.  It is one of the most useful things that you never knew you needed.  Of all of the Alexa options, I would pick the Echo Dot based solely on its versatility and low price point.  It has all of the functionality of the full size Echo and you can pair it with a high quality Bluetooth or wired speaker system for better results than you can get with the Echo alone.  I would and have bought this product again.","December 30, 2016"

It will randomly connect to my Google pixel and play whatever sounds should be coming from my phone without me asking it to.

I was pleasantly surprised that she even could play what I would consider to be ""locally"" known songs from back-in-the-day (meaning songs that got no radio play outside of the Bay Area, CA). My only complaint is that I want louder volume, but I'm having difficulty connecting Alexa to my speaker wirelessly...","January 14, 2017"

It can rarely hear me and most requests are answered with it telling me that it doesn't understand and can find the answer. I'm not asking complicated things. I've asked questions like ""who are the beattles?"" And ""how many branches of military are there?"" Standard stuff that I already know the answer to. It doesn't seem to comprehend to simplest questions. Now I have nothing more than a different device to play pandora on. I'm not impressed. Should've gone with the Google home.","January 20, 2017"

We already have Alexa and I ordered the dot to keep in my bedroom whereas Alexa is in the family room. But my 3 year old loves the dot better and wakes it up several times asking to play her favorite songs. She calls it baby Alexa! Highly recommended Alexa for any home! Great help turning a small apartment into a  smart apartment with smart light switches that's saves us on the electric bill. Echo dot is great. I do miss the rotary dial for the volume like Alexa has, the buttons are weird to press. But it's not a problem. Responds well and fast.","October 25, 2016"

I do usethe alarm feature in the mornings but I've had issues getting it to ""end"" or ""snooze"" the alarm. I have to almost scream""Alexa"" for it to hear me when the alarm is going off.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Rob Dale","What a Great Product!","After reviewing the Echo Dot and the Google Home, we decided on the Echo. The primary reason was Bluetooth! We are a member of Amazon Prime, and Alexa works well with their music. Bluetooth allows for independence from the small speakers on the Echo. Simply ask Alexa, ""Listen to music from Celine Dion and connect with Bluetooth."" Echo does it and does it well. Using wireless headphones makes it a magical experience.Amazon has produced a product that is not only the best in its technology, but a price point that is affordable to all. Great job Amazon!","January 6, 2017"

I've read on forums, and this seems to be a common issue, but I'm waiting for it to be resolved. I'm using it in a small apartment, so I cannot judge its range; but the microphones seem to be quite sensitive, and pick up audio even when I speak very softly, and sometimes from afar.","January 3, 2017"

It is rare for an Apple technology to pale in comparison to others, but Siri is a big downer compared to Alexa.I am now branching into smart home devices and so far the Spot's integration with them is superb.It won't be long before every house in America has an Echo or a Spot - it's simply a must-have.","January 25, 2017"

The sound is like listening to an AM radio, so I've paired it with a JBL Charge bluetooth speaker and it sounds amazing.

I find that I use this daily for music and just random silliness. It's very helpful in the kitchen with measurements and recipes. The speakers built in are decent and work for a small room.

Amazon, how about adding a 4 ft cable instead of this little shortie. Also, having the option to choose between a female or male voice.

I bought an Echo last year when they first came out - I love it and use it all the time. I found myself wishing I had one in every room. The Dot is the perfect solution to that! I bought one for my bathroom - great for quickly getting the time, the weather, news and traffic while you're in the middle of getting ready in the morning. I ended up adding an external speaker to my Dot so I could jam out to my Spotify list while I'm in the shower. One complaint - I ordered the white Dot to match my bathroom decor. The quality of the included cord and plug-in is great, but they are black!!! I assumed the white Dot would come with white cords. Nope!!! The big black cord looks ugly in my white bathroom with my white Dot, but I guess I'll just have to get over it since I love the Dot so much!!","November 19, 2016"

And when I ask Dot to play music it cuts off in the middle of a song.  I checked the Alexa App for the list of commands to see why it would start playing and there is nothing in the commands for Dot?

IE I asked it to play prince and it played some hard core rap artist and I like an artist named Musiq and it didnt have a clue. for other basic commands like getting news, fitbit stats, audibles and playing more common known music its great.","January 12, 2017"

Thing I most wish it did better: play podcasts.  It can play some, but the selection is poor and there's no way of choosing a particular episode, it just plays the most recent.  We've also had some connectivity issues with our wifi and a couple of days where it required complete re-set-up two or three times a day.  If that problem had not resolved, I would have returned it.  I'm hopeful that it will become more versatile and for the price, I can't really complain.","February 13, 2017"

Luckily, he was able to see my order, and understood they weren't stolen, and he 'flipped the bit' properly.Once setup, the Dot's worked fine.  I setup an alarm (""Alexa, set an alarm for 8:15"")  and it worked perfectly.I was able to get Alexa to play a number of songs, but not to recognize (ala Shazam or Soundhound) any.Slightly more sophisticated queries are mishandled (""Alexa, what versions of Gloria can you play?"" was treated like ""Alexa, play Gloria"")(And she plays the wrong version of Gloria.  Hmmph.  :)A request ""Alex, play Gloria by Van Morrison"" got a response that it wasn't in my library, but was available (""stereo version"")from Amazon Music Unlimited.

I just got the dot because I didn't want a high price tag for something like this and it works fine on it's own. I am not a connoisseur of music and I find that the small speaker inside the Dot is just fine for me. It can do math for you and help you with spelling. The only down side I am having is when it is playing music or a timer / alarm it has trouble hearing it's name so you can pause or turn it off, sometimes I have to say Alexa 2 or 3 times before it hears me.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Chris","It's OK","Still needs A LOT of work vut here's my opinion so far;PROS:• Great music player. I would argue it's the best feature, the Echo is excellent at pulling up music, sports, and radio stations.• News briefing. You can build your own custom news briefing from just about every news source, even stack news sources for multiple briefings.• Audio out port. The dot has an audio out port so you can hook up an external speaker or a set of bluetooth speakers through bluetooth.• Basic Q&A. Alexa is good a VERY, VERY basic Q&A. Alexa's data comes from Bing.com, so when you ask a question that Bing.com doesn't answer, and Bing hardly answers anything more complicated than 'Who was the 40th president?'. The biggest failure of this product, to me, was to put so much faith behind Bing.CONS:• The 'awesome' far field mics aren't that awesome. You have to speak like a robot for it to perfectly understand you. Otherwise, you could be getting the weather in London when you don't care.• Advanced Q&A terrible. Getting ready for heavy doses of 'Sorry. I don't know the answer."" Like I said, Bing isn't Google and needs a major overhaul.• SKILLS, or lack thereof. This part of the Echo family I hate the most. If you've ever owned a Pebble smartwatch, you already have plenty of experience with this silly concept. Basically, you can download 'skills' which are apps that can be triggered by a VERY SPECIFIC phrase to utilize different companies' Echo app. For example, the commercial of people ordering a Pizza on Alexa he says 'tell Dominos' to trigger the Dominos app or skill. Most apps, or skills, that are available don't work well and require an often hard to remember or grammatically incorrect phrase to trigger the apps, which are either severly limited or weren't worth the download. Music is the only skill they got right.In summary, this has become a voice activated music library. For that purpose, this thing is awesome and totally worth the $50. However, if I were to grade the music feature with the rest of the Echo's so called features, I wouldn't give it more than 3 stars. It was a giant disappointment for me, as I expected at least Google level answers to my questions and get far from it. The skills are borderline worthless (unless you like meditating and facts about dogs, cats, and celebs). The voice recognition isn't bad but isn't great either.I'll leave it here for now. If updates drastically change the functionality, I'll leave an update.","January 11, 2017"

To my point, tried many platforms n this blend of hardware, operating system n software is near perfect. No need to talk in direct word for word commands, you literally in layman terms can say,ask,quiery anything in casual speech n Alexa responds. Once you invest, slowly if needed, in accessories like wifi outlets for light etc, thermostat to everything. Being disabled it brings you some freedom. I can not only ask for it to turn up the heat, start a timer or set alarm, ask the dumbest questions with best answers I can ask it to start brewing coffee n turn on lights when I wake up without even getting out of bed yet. I could go on n on n on, truth be. You think of it, they already did first and the option is there to just ONE CLICK ENABLED FOR SIMPLE EXTRAS TO most complex without even talking to an IT guy, its that simple. I would prefer just this echo dot part to my new iPad Pro 13vinches n that was 1200$. Easily.......trust me, just buy this device to try and you will be addicted just after seeing the ease of set up. It's magic. This one item was just the start for me, not trusting any devices in this tech category I bought the cheapest to try n not waste money......DAY later I wanted top of line version n this dot is still useful as you can add it to another room n connect em all n use the echo as hub n dots as terminals, figuratively. Trust me even your great grandmother who never used a cell phone yet could use this easily, and would use it non stop too. This has the potential to put a lot of devices out of business,simply cus it does the job of every device. I would summarize it up to this line. This device is like having a portal to all information, tasks, butler,maid, professor, clocks( you won't use ur clocks anymore lolol or watch news or weather news when all u do is say, "" Alexa, what's the weather today"" or "" do I need an umbrella or coat"" etc...simple n very effective. I started a game the 2nd day I bought it, keep asking questions or tasks to do till it asked or said I don't know, still have not stumped her yet, I even finally said "" Alexa, what can't you do?""....lolol.....she actually made a joke and said that is one thing I do not know...lolol....I was laughing for an hour, she actually has an attitude, scary. It's literally a person in your house n best parts, no fees r subscription for anything. Right down to she will shop n order things you need for you, all you do is ask.....I could go on forever but Alexa could tell you herself lolololol. Seriously she will actually tell u when asked what she can do......unreal","December 11, 2016"

We have two Echos...one upstairs and one downstairs.  I wanted something for my office, so I bought a Dot based on it having bluetooth.I connected the Dot to a bluetooth enabled Panasonic home theatre system that was sitting around unused.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","iyc_nyc","Brought my old-school stereo system back to life, and so much more..","This is an amazing gadget, and a steal. I agree with all the glowing reviews, so won't rehash them. I'll just add that this 3.5"" device has revived my 20 y.o. stereo receiver, the one I've been close to donating/giving away, to potentially replace with a Sonos system. That's no longer on the table, as the Dot + my stereo system now provides all the music I could want, and does so much more. I have the Dot connected to my receiver via this AmazonBasics 3.5mm to 2-Male RCA Adapter Cable - 8 Feet, and my receiver in turn is connected to two passive B&W speakers (left and right channels). The sound comes out in perfect stereo, with very good audio quality and separation.Be aware that a number of standard 3.5mm cables and headphone plugs are not fully compatible with the Dot. None of my existing cables or headphones, with the exception of my iPod earbuds, worked with the Dot -- when the Dot was connected to them, it only played in monotone, through one speaker/ear. It took some trial and error, and a few online user forums, to figure out that the Dot's audio jack is configured such that some cables can't plug in all the way to make full contact, even when they appear to be all the way in. This appears to be a physical/mechanical (vs software) problem; Amazon really should have tested the Dot's audio jack with a wider variety of cables.Again, you are safe using Amazon's own AmazonBasics 3.5mm to 2-Male RCA Adapter Cable - 8 Feet, linked above (assuming no compatibility issues between the RCA plugs and your receiver). If you are connecting the Dot to a receiver, speaker, or other device with a 3.5mm jack, Amazon's counterpart AmazonBasics 3.5mm Male to Male Stereo Audio Cable - 4 Feet (1.2 Meters) will likely work.Unfortunately, if the Dot is connected to an external speaker/receiver via a cable, it won't play through its internal speaker, even when your speaker/receiver is off. This means you essentially can't use your Dot unless your receiver is on (or disconnected from the Dot). As a workaround, I plan to also pair my Dot with a bluetooth speaker; apparently you just need to tell the Dot to turn on bluetooth, and it'll switch to that (vs. your cable-connected speaker).For those that have or want to get multiple Alexa devices, the devices are not currently integrated or synced, for both better and worse. For worse, you can't set your devices as multiple speakers playing the same music across multiple rooms. For better, you can use each device simultaneously for distinct purposes - e.g., playing music on one while issuing commands or asking questions on the other, even when both are right next to each other; or playing different music on each one, as when people in the same home are using them in different rooms and want to listen to their own music. Obviously, it'd be ideal if Amazon offered the option to select either modality (synced or distinct), which my guess is will come in the future.I'd assumed that the Dot was meant to be an add-on to the Echo, so you could access the Echo from another room via the Dot. In actuality, they are two separate, near equal partners, with each having slightly different capabilities (the Echo's main advantage being a much better built-in speaker, which comes at a cost; and the Dot taking up less space and having the ability to be connected to an external speaker/entire sound system that could easily surpass even the Echo's built-in speaker).The devices have gotten so good at picking up sound, and in particular their 'wake word', that if they are even 30 feet apart, you'll want to change the wake word and have a different one for each, or both will 'hear' you. When they're not playing music, my Echo and Dots can hear me from a full room away, even when I'm speaking at a near whisper. It's spooky - they seem to hear better than any human can, especially after some practice!By design, they are supposed to be able to sense the device closest to you, and have that one respond; but it'd be easier and more reliable to just have different wake words for each of them. Currently, as of this review (12/8/16), Amazon lets you change the wake word from Alexa to either Amazon or Echo. That way you can have three different devices, each answering to a different name. :)","December 8, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Bubbalicious","Best Drinking Buddy Ever!","Best drinking buddy ever!Everyone has a different angle on how Alexa changed their life and I'm no exception.PROS:Excellent Microphones - it has microphones on the periphery, so she hears me from different angles, and in a noisy room!Excellent Blue Tooth - I was able to go 50 feet with my blue tooth headphone.  Yes, beyond specs!Design - the simple LED lit hockey disk look good in most settings.Endelsss Fount Of Knowledge - now it's as simple as ""Alexa, wiki electoral college.""  ""Alexa, weather.""  etc. etc.Best DJ Ever - Ever sit around with friends listening to music and say, ""Remember that song?"", but you couldn't really be bothered to get up because you were kind of inebriated.  Now it's as simple as saying, ""Alexa, play Rubberband Man by the Spinners.""  You can change the mood of your party with a simple request.  It even understands my slurred speech!Oh, and it comes with a bartender recipe tool! (note:Mixing of drinks, still requires getting up.)  Alexa has many skill sets along with cooking recipes too.  Feeling down?  Just tell her to play you some comedy.  It's the ultimate whim machine!CONS:Minimal speaker - I pair a high quality battery operated blue tooth or my headphone for a hifi experience.  The quality is then excellent!Should have a cordless option - like an optional disc it sits on that's rechargeable for hours of cordless use.  This would be a HUGE improvement to go with the waterproof release.One Voice - I think it could have more than one voice, I'm sure many would appreciate a Stephen Hawkings option or whatever.  That option wouldn't even require a visit to the recording studio.SUMMARY:For $50 I get a dumb version of HAL from the movie ""2001"".  I'm living in the future!  I think I'll get some Echo controlled outlets next!NOTE: I used the computer registration page at alexa.amazon.com from my laptop.  The instructions tell you connect to Echo Dot's amazon-xxx network that should show up in the available wifi networks.  It didn't show up or would pop in and out.  Not until I disconnected my laptop from my home network did I see the availability of the amazon-xxx network.  After that, it was easy.  Just a flaky network discovery issue, but I read a few of these on the internet.  People with the smartphone ap or tablet should have a smoother discovery and registration process.","January 26, 2017"

The speaker isn't too bad, but I use it with a blue tooth speaker and it sounds great. For the price, I can't complain too much, now if I bought the regular echo for full price these complaints would be a real problem.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","AlBsure","Good start but the mic and listening interpretation should be improved","Very good in general. Really nice if you put in the effort to install home automation devices for lighting and hvac.But here are a few caveats:-Playing TV nearby will trigger Alexa to start listening occasionally.-The mic is probably not good enough to accurately hear you across a room unless it is absolutely quite. I would suggest placing this in a central location in the room.-You'll need to tell Alexa to stop if it's playing music before issuing new commands, as the music lyrics will be picked up by Alexa.-Basically any sound after you say ""Alexa"" can be interpreted as a command that means background noise, family/guest conversations, and tv/radio can give you some miss fires.-Training is available but doesn't seem to help with above problems. Speech recognition gets better, but it's not distinguishing who is speaking.Tips:-Once you understand these caveats, you can better position the device. I'd suggest placing it away from a tv or speaker set and as close to the center of a room as possible, but not near a dinner table or sectional couch (avoid loud conversation spaces).-Plug in your speaker by an aux cord (I'm using a bose mini sound link). Don't pair with bluetooth, unless you don't mind getting up to turn on the speaker and then asking alexa to pair every time. As with most bluetooth speakers, the mini sound link will power off after some idle time. If I have to get up, I might as well just get my smartphone which is then much more convenient than trying to say the right thing to Alexa. But keep in mind the audio from the speaker can trigger Alexa commands so position it wisely.-Keep one dot in the bathroom, it's really great for music, radio, sports, traffic, and weather while you shower and get ready.-Get TPLink smart plug, smart light switches, and dimmable/color bulbs and set up several categories and themes in Kasa app and Alexa app. IMO that is really the most killer Alexa feature. You can adjust all your lighting, dimming, colors etc with a single command.-Has spotify integration, which works alright. I like iHeartRadio as well. But other than that you'll have to get to know and love Amazon's music offering if you want to use Alexa as your personal DJ. I personally have never used Amazon's music service before this and I can't speak to it's catalog or how soon it gets new releases. Important to look at these services beforehand if that is important to you.-Nest integration is pretty cool, but if you have a nest you'll rarely need to adjust the temp manually. That's the whole point of having a nest. So this is more of a novelty. But it is nice to tell it when you're leaving to put nest in an eco mode.-IMO most of the other 'skills' are novelty and have very little practical use.-Enable purchase control! Those alexa deals are tempting but I had an accidental purchase caused by tv noise. I had to cancel later on that one.-Smartplug+Electric Projector Screen+Echo Dot!It would be great if it worked with specific people's voices and reduced some of these false triggers. Let's see if they hear us and implement that in the 3rd gen or with software changes.","December 4, 2016"

Personally I have no problem with the speakers in the Dot. I do have a Bose Soundlink color bluetooth speaker that I will use when I play music. I would say if you regularly stream music and you don't have an external speaker or don't want the inconvenience of plugging in and out then I would go with the full size Echo. If you have a full size Echo you can still use the Dot in another room which to me is ideal. Either way, you can't go wrong.","December 9, 2016"

I'm currently using it to gain voice access to my LIFX light bulbs.

"2.0 out of 5 stars","John Grieggs","Not ready for prime time","Echo Dot is fairly cool when it works.  When it decides not to work, which seems rather random, it does it quietly, and you lose all control.  For example, right now, both of my Dots, in different rooms, light up and are clearly hearing me talk, but refuse to provide time, weather, or control over my alarms.  No error, just no working.  I've tried rebooting.  I can't tell what is wrong.  This is unacceptable for devices that are meant to control various facets of my house.  An Alexa device should never fail silently - it should either work, or tell me that it isn't going to work, preferably with some sort of descriptive error and estimate of when or how it might be fixed.  My internet connection and other devices are working fine - it isn't a connectivity issue.  I would NOT trust an Alexa device with anything important at this point.  If I can't trust it to tell me what time it is, why would I trust it to control my door locks, cameras, or thermostat?  I didn't give it a bottom rating but it is fairly cool when it works, but the unreliability and lack of error reporting make it a product I will not be recommending to my friends.  I do not trust it to wake me up in the morning, as it should based on my existing daily alarm, and am extremely annoyed that it will not allow me to adjust that alarm nor provide me with any status as to why that might be.","March 7, 2017"

I have noticed she misinterprets some of the  things you ask and also picks up things from the tv that sound like they said Alexa.

Same thing happens if the alarm goes off or I'm playing music at a moderate volume.

The same 25 - 50 songs out of a library of over 25K songs play every time.  It is good with finding songs in my library.I called Amazon customer support about the shuffle problem.  After jumping through hoops (reboot router, modem, Echo, etc.) for about an hour, I was told that they would look into it.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Brian Hartman","Excellent assistant, passable Bluetooth speaker.","I really love my Amazon Dot.  It's fairly easy to set up, the voice recognition works at a good distance, and it's got loads of functions.Here are some of the things I do with it on a daily basis:1)  Listen to radio stations on iHeartRadio and TuneIn.2)  Use it as an alarm clock.3)  Listen to my Amazon music.4)  Listen to Amazon Prime.5) Get flash briefings.6)  Control the light in my bedroom.7)  Look for information with Alexa.8)  Track Amazon packages.The far field microphones do a good job of picking up your voice from anywhere in a room, and I've had it work when I was in another room.Where it doesn't work so well is in Internet searches.  It doesn't use Google, so keep that in mind.  You're not going to get the same level of information or the same level of natural language processing as you'd get with Google Now.  In other words, you're more likely to hear ""I'm not sure how to answer your question"" from Alexa than you would with Google Now.  Alexa is more of a task assistant than an information gopher.I'm planning on getting more smart bulbs for my apartment.  Right now, I only have my bedroom light set up with Alexa.  I had to buy a hub for it, and a smart bulb, with the total cost for both being $50.  But they work well.  ""Alexa, bedroom light on/pff"" controls the light now.  I'm looking forward to getting more bulbs for it.The other thing is that the speaker isn't the best.  $50 doesn't buy you a great Bluetooth speaker in this case.  It's passable to listen to music to, but it's not as good as a dedicated Bluetooth speaker of the same size.  What you're really paying for with the Dot is what it can do, rather than how great it sounds.On the whole, I'm very happy with the Amazon Dot.  It's a great little device at a fraction of the price you'd pay for the Echo.","November 20, 2016"

It seamlessly integrated with our Amazon Music account and to be able to call for a song, or artist, or play list and have it play is wonderful. What I thought would be a toy has turned into much more.","January 26, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","A Bronx Tale","I'm Sure it Will Get Better","My office and home have poor radio reception. I use the dot in conjunction with iheart radio to listen to my radio stations. The bad thing about the dot is: 1- It must be plugged in at all times as it doesn't have an internal battery 2- It has to be connected to wi-fi as it cannot connect to blue tooth and 3- Connecting to another speaker like my Bose requires a physical wire since it does not have blue tooth.The speaker is fine foe radio listening but another speaker is definitely needed to connected when playing my music.","February 16, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Dave","Echo Dot or Google Home?","Echo Dot or Google Home?That is the questions we all will be asking now that Google has launched their own home assistant. I Have the 1st gen Dot and now this 2nd gen.  I Have one in bedroom and another in family room and they work great together. A recent New software update makes it so only one Dot activates depending on the distance I am from it.  I Have Alexa tied into my Lutron and Lifex lights, and iHome smart plugs and Alexa works flawlessly with these devices.  I use Alexa for daily briefings of my schedule and news, get weather, find out my commute time to work, have ordered pizza through Dominos, and have activated multiple skills, which new ones are being added all the time.  Skills are written by developers and allow Alexa to perform new tasks, think of skills like an app on your phone, each app has its own function.  Alexa is not perfect, but you have to consider Amazon was the first to come out with this technology for mass market home use and for the functions it can perform it works awesome.  Very well supported by Amazon with weekly emails telling you what new skills Alexa has, and Alexa gets smarter all the time.Just recently they let developers tap into the Alexa API and we have already seen a update to have alexa work with the todolist app, which allows you to add to do's to one of the best apps out there.  Did I mention it can work with hundreds of smart home devices!  Some might be wondering if Google home that just launched might be the way to go.  I would say it really depends on your needs.  Google home will be like google now in a voice format and will tap into Google and be able to answer hundreds of questions, set timers, alarms, add to a shopping list, play music, and control Chromecast on your TV,  but will have far fewer smart home devices that work with it and set you back $129.00.  Alexa Dot will cost you $49.00 and will not be able to answer has many questions, but will tap into hundreds of smart home devices, be able to set timers, alarms, to do's, shopping lists, order Dominos pizza, give you a daily briefing of news, play music from multiple sources like Amazon Music, Pandora, and more.  To really make home assistants work well especially with smart home devices you really need more than one so you can cover your home with them. At $49.00 each it's far more economical to do this with the Dot.  I hope this review helps others to make a good decision.","November 5, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Matt","Great product and service","Was really excited to receive my echo dot 2nd gen. But within only a couple weeks of regular use the echo dot stopped working switched out power cords and wall plug adapter and nothing worked.. Was able to contact customer support and amazon for help.. They was able to send replacement product and went  above and beyond my expectations. I'm thinking  it was a overheat issue due too small vent ports on the bottom. Id like that modified if a new gen is made .. So be sure to give your ""Echo Dot 2nd Gen.

From getting the news in the morning to listening to music in the evening while cooking dinner and cleaning up, it's all effortless. No phone to pull out and search for the right music or recipe or information. I do have to watch my kids during homework time or they ask Alexa the answers lol.We are still getting acclimated to all the things Alexa can do but I can say already, it is fun and helpful. I will be buying another for my bedroom as well.","February 3, 2017"

She spends most of her time in our bedroom, but her portability leaves lots of options to explore. The built-in speaker is admittedly nothing to write home about, but it's really  not terrible either. Some reviews that I have read complained that Dot has trouble hearing. I have found that she seems to hear better than her big sister in the living room. She has rapidly become a valued family member and I couldn't be more pleased.","December 18, 2016"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Jamie Lyn","Not as good as the original Amazon Echo.","Bought this for my bedroom to control my lights and play music. Glad I have the original Amazon Echo for the main part of my house. The dot is definitely not a substitute for the original Amazon Echo but rather a mediocre addition to it. The sound quality isn't as good but I expected that considering the size of the dot. So I just have it hooked up to my bedroom surround sound and let my good quality speakers do all the heavy lifting. The dot is very handy for controlling my lights after I've gotten into bed and am ready to sleep. However, at least once a week the dot will respond to one of my commands telling me that there is a problem with the connection and that it will need to be reset. Don't have a problem connecting any of my other devices in my bedroom and my original Amazon Echo has never failed me like this. So what the heck dot? It also defies me on a regular basis. I'll ask it to turn off the nightstand lights and it will only turn off one. Or I'll ask it to turn off my dresser light and it will turn on my nightstand lights. Super frustrating. It makes mistakes like this on a regular basis whereas my original Amazon Echo doesn't. If you love your original Amazon Echo and are thinking of getting a second but are feeling cheap...don't cheap out like I did. Just buy another original. Or if you are wanting your very first Echo and think that a dot is a good way to test it out to see if you like it before spending all that money, quit being cheap and just buy the original.","February 27, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Anthony Bush","Sleek!","I love my dot! I almost prefer the first generation since it still spun to turn up the volume instead of just having the volume up/down buttons, but that seems to be the only major change to the outside of the dot generations. I really love the white version, looks beautiful near other white electronics like Xbox One S, white PS4, etc. Very sleek! Obviously Alexa herself is consistently growing and improving and she's wonderful. At $39 these make great gifts for yourself of friends/family. You won't be disappointed!","January 15, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Bill","Four Stars","Be aware that the Echo Dot must be plugged in to operate.  The description of the older Ehch Dot described the power cord as a ""USB charging cord,"" implying it would charge a battery - not so.  Most of the pictures we see of the Dot standing alone do not show a power cord.  This makes a difference in where you might like to place it.  It is well made, the speaker sounds pretty good, but it only answers very simple questions.  If you want it to operate other ""gadgets,"" it will probably meet you needs.","January 15, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","kaljclo","Underwhelming at best.","I am one of the Prime members who bought the Echo when it was first released and I loved it.  I only had the one and it was getting to be a hassle transferring Alexa from my kitchen windowsill to my daughter's bedroom to play her music at night, so I decided to get a Dot.  The first gen was unavailable when I tried to buy one but soon after that the 2nd Gen was released, so that's the one this review is for.I'm incredibly underwhelmed.  I didn't expect the same level of performance as I got with the Echo, but this little guy is next to useless.The most disappointing thing about him is the lack of voice recognition he provides.  I have the Dot sitting on my daughter's dresser, which is about 5 feet from her closet where I store her cloth diapers.  I typically try to tell the Dot to turn her music on from the closet while I am getting her in her night time diaper and it never works.  Somehow I keep forgetting and I keep trying and I just continue to be frustrated every night when he doesn't hear me (I come from a family of loud people and I do not mumble...it shouldn't be that difficult to pick up what I'm saying).  Her room is otherwise silent so there's no noise interference, either.  I have to walk over to the dresser and put my face about 6"" from the Dot for him to recognize that I'm speaking to him.  I don't really see the point in having this device if the voice recognition feature is useless...The sound is barely audible if there is *any* other noise in the Dot's general vicinity.  My 6 year old was horsing around in my kitchen about 2 weeks ago and he knocked my beautiful Echo out of the window and she shattered all over my kitchen tile.  The horror of that occasion is a story for another day, however, as I only mentioned it because yesterday I was cleaning and wanted to listen to some festive music at the same time.  I lay my head on the Dot where I must put it in order for the da** thing to understand me and asked it to play me a holiday station on Pandora.  I started to walk away and realized by the time I got to my daughter's doorway I couldn't hear the music at all in my otherwise quiet home.  I walked back and attempted to ask him to turn the volume up, but alas...with the quiet tones of holiday music emanating from his body he couldn't hear me even from half a foot away.  I pushed the + button repeatedly until the Dot was at its full sound capacity and walked away again.  I went into my bedroom, which is directly around the corner from my daughter's bedroom door, and the music was completely inaudible again.  Back to my daughter's doorway I went.  I realized that I'd have to stand in her room to hear the music at all.  If I had the Dot in my room and wanted to jam to music, even at full volume, I would *definitely* need an external speaker.  I don't need my home reverberating from the bass of my Dot the way it does with an Echo at full volume, but I did expect it to be at least USABLE without dishing out the dough for a Bose audio system.All in all, I am honestly disappointed with this purchase.  If I wanted something I have to plug into an external speaker to use at all, and be within kissing distance of to activate it, I'd plug my phone into my sound bar and use that (hint: I don't).  With the Google Home out now and the potential it has to be much more than the Echo has to offer (not to mention that it's about $40 less), I think I'll forego getting another Echo and try out a different device.  I'll always think fondly of Alexa, but I think it's time to move on from the Echo products.","November 19, 2016"

While it may not be good enough for hearing bass, the plus was that it can be connected with any bluetooth speaker. I had a soundbar and pairing was a breeze.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Jamie","Why I Chose the Dot Over the Echo","I did quite a bit of research before deciding whether to buy the Echo, Tap, or Dot. After finding out that the Dot was basically the same exact thing as the Echo, except the Dot doesn't have a built in music speaker, and it's less than 1/3 of the price of the Echo, and I have an Onkyo receiver the Dot plugs into to play music through my home stereo system, I decided that the Dot was the smartest choice for my needs. After all, why should I pay three times more for the Echo when chances are I would want it to play music through my home's sound system anyway? So the Dot it was.I have a lot of things in my home Alexa can interact with. My TV. My thermostat. It's a basic list for now but it does make things easier. We also have a Samsung Hub (2nd generation).Now, I have six kids, two of whom are toddlers. I also have three conditions that cause chronic pain and two of those cause severe flare ups. If I wake up and the room is too hot I can tell it to turn the air conditioning up without enduring severe pain to get out of bed, go across the house, and turn the thermostat down. If I'm fighting with my toddlers to get dressed in the morning Alexa can tell me what the weather is and I can pick long sleeves or short sleeves (yes it can and does get chilly in Florida).There are a lot of smart home products that interact with Alexa, although right now it's limited in its functions. I want to be able to say, ""Alexa start the coffee"" and have coffee ready for me when I make my way into the kitchen. Or say ""Alexa stream Disney's Frozen to the bedroom TV"" so I can set up a movie for the girls without me having to log into the PS4 and do it. So while I do love the device I will keep my review at 4 stars until more functionality is added.Overall it really is a convenient voice-activated smart home assistant. And unless you really want the speaker I suggest the Dot over the Echo. With that being said. For it to get five stars they need to integrate more products and features into it.","October 24, 2016"

The frequent downtime makes it a frustrating toy and you wouldn't dare use it for important stuff like home alarms, alarm clocks, thermostats, heaters, electric locks, etc.  Theother flaw - it misunderstands many words and simply can't do a lot.Edited 4-7-2017 -With time Alexa, Echo and Kasa have become more nightmarish and less useful - each time the power goes out (and that happens with some frequency in the south) Alexa, Echo and Kasa EACH play dumb and won't reconnect with wifi (funny how my phone and laptop have no such issue)... so I have tomanually turn the lights on and off three timesper bulb and do three manual reconnects and then do the same for every smart plug - the process takes about an hour for 6 items as the automatic modes on Kasa tend to fail... the sad thing is that as they upgrade software this gets worse... if I could give ZERO stars I would.  This is simply NOT ready for retail.  Great idea.. lousy programming.","March 7, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","J. Soto","Cheapest way to have Alexa device -- decent audio!","Audio was better than expected.  Obviously not as robust sounding as our Echo, but closer than I expected. Paired with a JBL speaker that is marginally better for playing music in the kitchen when wired (not very good via Bluetooth, but that's probably the JBL speaker's issue and not the Dot's). Considering buying another Dot.","November 24, 2016"

Also, when I connect the external speakers using the 3.5"" aux speaker jack, it of course cuts off the internal speaker.  But, if my receiver is not turned on, then I can't hear Alexa talk.  It would be good to have the option to leave the internal speaker on even if the aux speaker cable is plugged in.  Rueben (Amazon tech) suggested maybe a small (always on) speaker that could be connected to the auxilery input via a Y connection.  I might try that.","February 15, 2017"

"1.0 out of 5 stars","cseken","HUGE HUGE HUGE SECURITY HOLE!!!!","HUGE HUGE HUGE SECURITY HOLE. ANYONE with a Bluetooth device can connect to this within range. There is NO PIN or any security to prevent someone from connecting to this device. I discovered this when the device reported my neighbor had connected via Bluetooth WITHOUT me doing anything. I was told by ""Amazon"" that the person connecting ""couldn't do anything with it"". They pretty much blew me off and opened a ""trouble ticket"" that went into an Amazon black hole. I'm no expert on Bluetooth, but seems like someone could connect and do malicious stuff with your device. In theory they could order stuff from Amazon Prime, control home automation, open your doors (if you have locks supported by Alexa), and the list goes on and on. What would prevent some ""bad guy"" from walking by your house, connecting to your device and gathering all kinds of information.They tried to convince me it was like connecting your Bluetooth device with your car. Not sure about what car they drive, but mine makes me setup a pin to pair.There is also NO WAY to disable Bluetooth for the devices. I have no choice except turn off or live with the chance that someone could hack into my Alexa at any time.","February 21, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Devin Householder","Better than expected!","I originally bought one for a Christmas gift, but curiosity got the best of me... I opened the first one, set it up and started playing with it. By the end of the week, I ended up getting several more. I love being able to ask it to play music without having to log onto an app or pair it to my phone. The headphone jack is nice to plug it into larger/better speakers... glad I didn't get the original Echo that didn't have this feature.She has a ton of 'hidden' conversational cues from sarcastic answers to dumb questions to sci-fi and pop culture references and quotes. These, of course, are fun for about 15 minutes before the novelty wears off... and this is when you realize how useful she can really be.Aside from music, being able to call out, ""Alex, turn on the lights"" or ""Alexa, use the guitar tuner skill to help me tune my guitar"" or having her do a myriad of other things is where The echo dot shines. For a small package, she does a lot. And it's USEFUL!At first, I thought she'd be a novelty that'll just wear off. However, I use her more and more.For about $15 less, you can buy a Bluetooth receiver for your stereo system... for what you get with the Echo Dot, it's totally worth the few dollars more.","December 28, 2016"

It has a built in speaker which isn't bad for as small as it is but the ability to connect it to speakers makes it awesome.","January 25, 2017"

Then it often just stops all together without any command.  It cuts out so often.  I have even used different music services and it still does it.  I do like it for some other things, like getting weather, news, timer and alarms.  I've tried a few skills that worked at first and now never work.  I was hoping the reviews I saw were not going to come true but they have for me.","January 15, 2017"

I have run into and issue that is totally frustrating.  I have a total of 14 Echo dots in my home.  I have 1 in each room, mostly to allow control of my smart home and spread out the wireless coverage to these devices.  This works fine.  Unfortunately, I discovered Amazon counts each Echo as a unique device towards my authorized devices for my Unlimited Amazon Music subscription, which means I can only have 4 of the Echos authorized since my other devices hold the other 6 spots.  This leaves me with 11 Echo devices through which I can not access my Amazon Music subscripiton.  My home consists of 2 people, with only myself ever using the music subscription.  This seems like a poor decision on Amazon's part.  Why would Amazon not authorize their own devices to not count toward these authorization limits?  Especially a non-mobile device like the Echo.  Amazon does so many things very well, but Amazon is really awful when it comes to supporting their very best customers.  This is not the only issue I have had with my generous adoption and utilization as a customer, becoming an inconvenience.  Amazon, why?","March 6, 2017"

I kind of like the original design with the adjustment ring for the volume instead of the two extra buttons.  It has a little faster of a response but there really was nothing wrong with the response time with the original in my view.  It just feels lighter and a little cheaper made.

Ours do lose internet connect quite a bit but I am thinking that is an issue with our internet provider not with the dots as we have issues on other devices. I absolutely recommend one even just for the fun factor. The price is definitely affordable for what you get.","January 26, 2017"

I don't have this issue with the Echo.  I contacted support and they recommended setting up the wi-fi again.  I did that, and it helped, but it's starting to do it again. I don't think that having to set up the wi-fi over and over is an answer.  I think they need to look at this issue and perhaps do a software upgrade.","January 8, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Lex Lyford","Good hardware, terrible app.  Looking forward to the next gen.","I set up an Echo Dot for a couple, they were hoping to control their SONOS system with it.  Unfortunately, it doesn't yet have that capability; the app for it is being developed by SONOS, so no fault of the Dot.  Their SONOS receiver does not have an audio input, so it can't play from the Dot, again, no fault of the Dot.However, there is one fairly serious flaw, it's the Alexa App.  It freezes constantly on several devices, and often won't open at all.  I've been trying for 3 days, reinstalled the app on several devices, but it just doesn't work.  That's a big deal.Also, setting it up with 3rd party devices is spotty.  I have a TP-Link Smart Plug, and Alexa just doesn't see it, even with the proper app installed.  I really wish it had a USB port and a Windows ap, so I could talk to it directly, not over wifi.So far, I've spent several hours just trying to get it set up properly and talk to other devices.  A good part of that time has been spent watching a little rotating circle because thee app won't launch.  Drives me nuts.  I've reset the Dot to factory several times in an attempt to get is working, but no dice.So, my wish list for the next generation of an Echo device is:A USB port & Windows App so I don't have to use the crappy Android AppThe ability to make phone calls, either through my smartphone or on Skype. (I hear the next gen is getting that, good).Access to my home server's music files.Either a cooler design or move the buttons & mic to the side so I can use it as a stand for something nice.","March 8, 2017"

The home automation integration is really useful, and I found Alexa to be increasingly useful.... at first.The first month with Alexa was great, but there are annoyances and limitations that have left me less excited as the first few months progressed.The biggest annoyance is that, no matter the placement of the Echo Dot, sometimes it doesn't ""wake up"" or respond to the trigger word. Sometimes I find myself yelling Alexa before she responds. I've tried placing high, or low, near, and far, but it doesn't change. Background noise is not an issue either.Alexa seems to become less intelligent/useful as time passes - ordering anything via Alexa is a chore, and I usually just skip it, using my laptop or tablet to place the order.Once the initial ""fun"" wears off, and you look for practicality, it often falls short.Alexa does excel at a few things, such as home automation integration and control, as well as a great music, and audiobook player.","March 14, 2017"

No more pen and paper!  Alexa is full of facts and will even tell you a joke if you want.  The price was great and as we have wireless speakers already, I didn't feel I needed to spend the extra money for the Echo as that was the only difference.  This was easy to get up and running.  It also works with our Phillips Hue light strip and Go light.  Alexa is able to turn them off and on.  There are a lot of capabilities such as getting daily news, music, weather and facts. If Alexa doesn't know an answer you can ask her to search Bing.  If you have Amazon Prime you can order items from Amazon. I have not used this feature because I have teenage grandson's living with us and fear the packages would start rolling in everyday with this type of freedom.

I will almost always be in the same room as Alexa and I don't need the sound to be loud because I don't want to disturb my neighbor. The Dot is perfect for my situation. The sound quality is perfect for me to listen to calming music while I sit at my desk and do school work all day. It's also perfect to help me keep track of appointments and lists. I forget to write things down all the time, and then I end up with a bunch of paper lying around when I do remember to take notes for little things. Setup was iffy at first, but simple when I figured out what I was doing wrong. Alexa has already read to me from one of my kindle books, told me the weather, a cheesy joke, set an reminder alarm for today, and put my appointments for the month on my calendar.

As time goes on and they update Alexa with more skills and more features, it'll be even a greater asset to have in your home. BTW, if you search online for Alexa's  ""easter eggs"", it's brilliant fun.","January 7, 2017"

The others have a few more bells and whistles but the vast majority of those is the built in speaker. Pretty cool but I'll tell you what else is cool, buying the jacks and just plug it into your stereo. We have a home Bose and there is no way the others sound as good as mine. What's also really cool is that it takes literally no space and ideal for those who can't stand clutter!","January 14, 2017"

So far the only partial solution has been to use Bluetooth speakers and place them more that 10 ft away from the Dot. If you never play music or news you might never notice this.

I totally recommend this product you must buy this, this is an amazing Christmas gift. The only downside to the Amazon echo dog or Alexa it does not work like Siri or Google homeA lot of the things you might ask Alexa she might not able to answer it but I'm betting in the fact that hopefully Amazon will keep upgrading the Excho software or the the Alexa system and hopefully in on a couple of months or a couple of years she'll be more interactive that's the only downside, when I ask her questions sometimes It doesn't understand me. It does not answer questions like Siri or Google Home.if you have a prime membership is great because you will be able to take a vantage of audiobooks and the amazon music, again I totally recommend it!!","December 8, 2016"

I have one in my bedroom. and the other is hidden in my living room. I like it as an instant night light, an alarm, timer and basic weather and news info..You can buy pricey ""smart"" light bulbs and sockets from amazon to turn your home into a smart home. ******Just a thought, If amazon wanted to do some good.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Ash","A home assistant, not a companion","A lot of people write reviews claiming that Alexa isn't smart enough and can't answer questions. The thing is, that's not what she's for AT ALL. She is not a dictionary, a companion, or an encyclopedia. She's a home assistant. She keeps you organized and is a great starting point for the internet of things. She super good at doing this job. As long as you don't expect a sentient AI friend, I'm sure you'll be happy with the Echo Dot.","April 2, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","White Raven","Device management & playing music is generally useful & functional","The Dot is OK for a limited range of commands, BUT is very inflexible. Commands must be simple with absolutely correct wording & word order. ""and"" & ""all"" are not recognized so device hierarchies must be thought out and predefined or you will sit there all day listing lights to be turned off!  Commands must be entered singly with a pause & the wake up word before each command. This is very limiting.Device management & playing music is generally useful & functional, but Echo may not understand some names well enough for a successful search.The Wikipedia facility should be useful, but is marginal.  It often fails with people's names.  Echo is either limited to a subset of the Wikipedia, or the voice recognition is so bad it will only match well known or easy to recognize names &  items to Wiki articles. Existing wiki articles are not always accessed. Sometimes the ""matching"" seems random:  Echo will read a wiki entry for something that does not sound remotely like the request, or will start listing movies playing in your area when the word movie was never spoken.","October 30, 2016"

Also, much like Siri, if you throw out odd or funny questions you get some entertaining responses. My mom loves asking what the weather is like and how traffic looks.

Especially if you have a great sound system in the room already.  In fact, if you do have a great sound system already I would say getting one of these is better than the full sized echo because of the mini phono jack on it.  Without a sound system, the speakers in it do a fine job, a bit tinny, I wouldn't want to listen to music through it, but it is fine for everything else.","November 3, 2016"

We are very happy with these guys and had the right expectations. I saw complains of audio quality but I mean seriously??? People use your brains... if you want high quality audio you clearly need to spend a lot more money than $49 on a smart home device that has a speaker. It's perfect to have when we play sleep music for the kids at night and our own music in the kitchen-- perfect volume to only hear in those specific rooms. As always new technology isn't perfect so sometimes the various smart home skills don't work (Alexa says they are offline but for example she still turns on hue lights off even after say it's not available). We've had to unplug power on them a dozen times as for some reason it disconnects from our wireless and just had the red light.. again not a huge issue as it takes 5 seconds of effort to fix. Overall we think these devices understand things better than Siri and look forward to what it'll bring in the future.","November 25, 2016"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Rich Garner","Amazing Little Helper","An amazing little device! Alexa is rather intelligent but does have a number of limitations. First, don't expect this to be the AI of your dreams. She can retrieve facts, play music and control devices, but she cannot differentiate one voice from another, or understand uncommon lingo, or carry on conversations, or take certain commands not related to information retrieval.But what she DOES do, she does well: She is a home-based assistant. She can give you hands-free access to important info that you may need or common features such as music, tv, timers, and recipes.The speaker on the Dot is far better than I expected. I was planning on hooking up a stereo to her in the kitchen, but it is really not needed. Music is clear and loud. I'm not sure if the only difference between this and the Echo is the speaker quality, but if it is, I really have no need for the Echo anymore.I still have lots of skills and features to explore, so this is just my review after a few days.","December 7, 2016"

Despite having two amazon acccounts for my wife and I, both added to Alexa under the ""household"" feature, we are unable to use our individual google calendars. The Alexa software will only allow you to specify a single calendar to which events are added. Regardless of which household account is active, events will only go to this one calendar. Changing the specified calendar changes the setting for both user accounts, making it impossible for me to add events to my calender, if she is to be able to add them to hers (or vice versa).I do not understand the purpose of the shared ""household"" accounts, when features I wish to be separated by account are shared (calendars feature), and features I wish were shared are separated (access to prime music).Two stars for the impressive microphone that doesn't miss a soft voice from across the room, but minus three for being multi-user unfriendly.","December 29, 2016"

I have successfully asked Alexa to ""Play CNN"", and it has always done that since I first started using my first Echo.  In the past 12 hours it no longer responds to this command, asking now what I want to hear, specific stories, latest news, etc. it will only play the CNN audio stream by forcing you to go to the Echo app.  I documented the issue in an email to Amazon!  They said I needed to call them directly to work on the problem.  I did, and spent more than 30 useless minutes on the phone with their representative.  At the end of my conversation with their representative she stated that it was CNN that changed the way my Echos respond to the command ""Alexa play CNN"", and I should contact them.  I would not know where to begin to do this.  Amazon's support regarding my issue, and most likely many other users who regularly listen to the CNN audio stream, via Tunein, was unacceptable.","March 10, 2017"

I have the Amazon Echo for my home coffee table,, the Amazon Tap for portability, and now the Amazon Dot I just installed in my car (which you have to have wi-fi in for it to work). Skills as to what she can do seems unlimited because they are being added all the time. I bought the Echo for 180, the Tap for 125 and now the Dot for 50. Oh, I have an Amazon Fire also. Love my Amazon products. You will too. If I sound like a salesman, it's because I am, but for a major cable TV/broadband HSD/digital phone company. I was not incentivized to do this review.  Make sure you get Amazon Prime for the maximum benefit! Enjoy!- Markp.s. - For those wishing to install Dot in your wi-fi enabled vehicle, I found you have to power the device by a USB portable charger external battery pack because I get feedback in the cars audio if powered by the vehicles own USB. Also Bluetooth is not supported by a connection that requires a pin, so I am connected for audio using a 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm. It's awesome for music, distance requests, some local business searches, Distance to destination info (it gives you the distance from point A to point B, and then adds, ""as the crow flies"".

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Mr Dapper","Alexa Dot 2nd Gen Review","Received my 2nd Gen Dots on Oct 20th while at work and had to wait all day to get home and set them up. I split a 6 pack with my dad and I already owned 2 others(The Original and the 1st Gen Dot) and couldn't wait to set my three 2nd Gen Dots up. I use the Alexa to control the lights and temperature at my house, as well as play music, ask questions, hear news/radio, and any of the apps that I can manage to remember the commands too(like ""trigger…"" from IFTTT).Set Up:Set up was easy since I had already setup an account when I setup the other two. After searching and finding the Dots, all I had to do was tell it which WiFi to connect to and rename it to the room/area I was going to put it at.Testing new Feature:After I set all of them up and but while I still had them all in the same room, I ran a test  to see how well the Echos' were at choosing which Echo was closest. Without fail every time that I said a command(from different locations), the closest echo was the only one that responded. All of the others indicated that they heard me, but then ignored me and let the closest one answer. In some tests I was only inches away from all of them and the one that heard me the clearest was the only one that responded.This is awesome! For any one that has had more then one Echo before this one, you know how annoying it was when you would say a command, like ""play music by so and so"" and every Echo would then start playing a random song from so and so. Before this update I had to change my Echo's summoning word so that they wouldn't always answer at the same time, which annoyed my wife and guests that could never remember which Echo was called ""Alexa"" and which one was just called ""Echo"" and for a while I had 3 and I had to call that one ""Amazon"". So now with this update, all of the Echo's (including the old ones) can now all have the same Summoning word of ""Alexa"", which is great now that I have 5 Echo's in the house now.With the coverage I now have in the house, I now no longer have any issues with Alexa hearing me. I have yet to connect any of them to external speakers, but I have never had an issue with that before. I will update this review if there are any issues or any questions any one has about it.The Look, the Feel, the Design, all while comparing it to the 1st gen:As for the look. That’s really up to you and your needs. I went with the white ones, mainly because I had 2 black ones already, but also I thought the white ones would fit better with my houses colour scheme. Which is more important to my wife, and now that they are here and setup, she agrees that I made the right choice.  The white ones fit in better and in some cases blended in with my house and can go unnoticed until needed.Comparing the 2nd Gen to the 1st Gens. They don’t feel as nice or as solid as the 1st Gen Dots, but then they do come $50 cheaper then that model and yet do everything just as well or better. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t feel like they are cheap, just that the 1st gen's where made heavier and with moving parts. I don’t have a problem with the buttons, but I did feel like the 1st Gen's volume control was nicer(for those that didn't get that model, it's volume control was the same as the Original Echo) Now I like that the 2nd gens are even more compact then the 1st Gens, and that they smoothed out a few of the edges.Conclusions:For my setup needs, I didn't need any more original Echo's, I just needed more locations to send commands to Alexa. That way we didn’t have to yell or walk to a room/area Alexa was in in order for it to turn lights on or change the temperature, or turn off music. The new Echo Dots(2nd Gen) were perfect for my needs.In conclusion, if you are new to Echo, Smart Home devices, or IOT, this is the model to go with. It packs a lot of function at a very good price point. If you are a Vet of the Echo life and want to expand or complete your Echo home setup, this model is great at a price you can be proud to tell your wife about.Tips and Tricks:I was able to cover my home without having to break the bank, and if you've got someone else interested like I did, you can split a 6 pack or 12 pack and get the discount without having to buy more then you need.3rd Party Add-OnI have purchased a battery pack that attaches to the base of the Dot and allows it to work for roughly 6hours without being plugged into the wall. Perfect for when I need to move from play to place or (as I have found useful) for quiet evenings in the front porch on the swing with the wife listening to an audio book. It also make it possible to set up the device to work through your phones internet and allow it to work virtually any place your phone works(like the Echo Tap, but voice only, no need to press a button). This was definitely a cool buy. My only gripe on the several models I looked at and the one I eventually bought was that I never felt like the battery was attached securely to the Dot. It hold up to some abuse, but if dropped it will most likely disconnect and take a few minutes to set back up. In all, though, if you've got an extra Dot, this was a great addition, and honestly, I like this setup more then I like the Echo Tap. The only draw between the two is battery life and speaker volume. The Dot can connect to an external Bluetooth or AUX speaker without any issues to allow it to connect to a louder speaker if sound or quality is your issue. You can also plug the Dot with the battery into power with a micro USB. That would allow the battery to stay charged or recharge if needed without stopping the jam…or audio book in my case.Model info: Evo - an intelligent Battery Base for Amazon Echo Dot 1st & 2nd Generation (""Alexa"" unlimited)https://amzn.com/B01L0XDHBOIf there is anything else you want to know or have questions about, please just let me know.

Perhaps I got a defective unit, but Amazon “helped” just long enough for it to be too late to return this garbage and I've been an Amazon Prime Customer for many many years.  I'm so disappointed.","March 12, 2017"

You have to keep this little sucker plugged in.AMAZON can't you make this little critter hold a charge so that we can take it with us. TAP & ECHO is to big to run around with. but DOT is just the right size. I want to be able to use VOICE COMMANDS without ""tapping"" on it. That is why I purchased DOT; however, I didn't know that DOT couldn't hold a charge. NO Beach, hiking outdoors with this one! :-(In concusion: This is what I'd love to see...the SIZE of DOT, with the capabilities of TAP (as far as being able to charge it goes). The auto voice commands without ""touching"" the DOT is excellent. Because when you have sun tan lotion or sand on your hands the last thing you want to have to do is ""TAP"" a device's button. Additionally, when you are ""outdoors"" beach, park,etc. there is often not an power outlet to plug your device into. AND since none of these devices are powered by batteries that mean that they would have to be ""charged"" prior to going to the beach, park, or something.DOTS sound is lower than the others because it's smaller. No problem I can just hook speakers to it like suggested; however, we really DESIRE for DOT to hold a charge like TAP!!!","January 10, 2017"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","MaGold","Alexa is my new best friend!","Alexa, what's the weather!  Alexa, tell me todays news! Alexa, let the dog out!  ... er.. two out of three ain't bad!  My son says I need a ""smart door"", I said I need a smarter dog.  But I digress.  I love love love this little hockey puck, er, Echo Dot.I first started using Alexa with the Fire TV box, but there are some things not programmed in it that I wanted, most notably alarms and timers.  I also decided that having to turn on the speaker then hold the button on the remote was too inconvenient, so I purchased the Echo Dot.  I am very very pleased with it overall, and love trying out new things to request of Alexa.  I will confess the two primary reasons I got it were: 1) to ask for time, weather, and news without ever moving in bed when I wake, not even opening my eyes, and 2) for playing music, especially at night, but anytime.  It is the feature I love most on the Fire TV Alexa, and it's even more convenient with the Dot.  I can say ""Alexa, play soothing music""; ""Alexa, play Neon Steeple album by Crowder""; ""Alexa, play Fionuoula Sherry""; ""Alexa, play classic rock""; ""Alexa, play The River by Dan Fogelberg"" and she does.  She learns what I like and will play music similar to that for requests like ""play soft music"".  I love that I can have a song on my mind and just ask Alexa to play it, so I can listen.  This is easily my favorite feature of Alexa-enabled devices.I have the white Dot, because I didn't want to wait two weeks for the black one to be in stock, and the white is very nice, glossy, and I am quite pleased to have it instead of the black, esp where I put it on my nightstand, the other items are all white as well.  There is a soft grip on the bottom to prevent it from sliding around.I am intrigued by the possibilities of controlling a ""smart home"", and if I had my own home, I would be adding smart devices.  However, the home I live in is definitely not ""smart"", and the people I live with are not interested in making it so.  So that is one area of Alexa's skills I likely won't try out much, though I may add a smart bulb/hub for my room eventually.Alexa operates off of pre-programmed ""skills"" (like, to ask for weather, or news, or time) and besides the ones that come already enabled, there are hundreds (thousands?) more available.  My 11 yr old grandson comes in my room for jokes and random facts, and on occassion to do homework (oops!).  There are skills to enable for most any desire or need, and more being added daily.  Strange as it may sound, I can see Alexa even being a boost to people, especially disabled and seniors, something to interact with when no people are around.  Sad fact of our world, but true.I dropped one star for a couple of issues.  1) On occassion Alexa said she had a connection problem, but when I asked her if she was connected, she said she was connected to the internet.  2) Alexa wakes easily to her name, whether from down the hall or next to the Dot.  However, while it seems she can hear a command even over other noise from down the hall, sometimes there are problems with her understanding and responding to a command over background noise when I am right next to the Dot.  It's a wierd issue that baffles me. 3) When Alexa is playing music, even from a bluetooth speaker several feet away that isn't loud, she does not wake.Overall, I am extremely satsified with the Echo Dot, and may give a few for Christmas gifts.  I am looking forward to see what improvements and new things are enabled through updates in the future.","November 6, 2016"

Alexa (the on-board voice assistant) can do a variety of things, such as look up something on Wikipedia, tell you the news and weather, tell you a joke and even control smart home devices around your house such as thermostats, locks and lights.  Alexa is a bit quirky and might not be able to do very specific tasks but with each update it learns how to do more tasks.","November 3, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","R. C. Lewis","Automation linked (with video), stereo sounds nice","I have a Wink controller, and have been adding home automation here and there around the house. I live in a three story home, and have added Dots to each level.Amazon Dots were easy to sync to my wireless and I linked them into my Wink account (or Wink was linked to Amazon app).  I have had no problem in setup, nor does Alexa have difficulty in hearing me.  In fact, when reviewing the video I just created off of my phone, Alexa started to respond to the video audio!On the top floor, I have the Dot as a stand alone and use it for an alarm clock, verbal bedroom thermostat (Nest) adjuster, and 'weather station'. I bicycle commute to work most days, and it is nice to know what to expect outside when I am getting up and getting prepped (ie warmer cycling clothing or cooler needed?).The downstairs Dot is in my office and currently is only answering questions and changing the second floor thermostat which impact temperature on the lower level.The second floor / living room Dot is connected to my Marantz stereo receiver (Monster 3.5mm to RCA cable).  My receiver is not wireless nor does it have Bluetooth. The Dot plays music through my receiver with decent/good sound quality. It also can turn on and off an automated outlet that is connecting a lamp in the living room.The Dots do not currently see nor control my automated front door lock or garage door, though Wink does.I have uploaded a short video that shows some of the automation in my living room being controlled by Alexa and Wink.  Sound quality in this video is not that decent; it was captured off my phone.  Don't mind the mini-tour, or my fur-balls.  I did not mention this in the video, but I can either ask Alexa to up the volume from the Dot's end, or I can manually change it from my receiver's controller.Let me know in the comments if you have any questions.","October 29, 2016"

"1.0 out of 5 stars","MIT Guy","Very Disappointed !","Very disappointed. I had great expectations for this device, as i was going to base my whole home automation on several of these devices however the following issues forced my to return it:1. Horrible Mic pick up. This is suppose to be the strong point of this device. Audio recognition for several people in my household was horrible. At 10 feet it was non existent. in other words, Echo would not even respond. Even after several session of ""voice training"", it still was terrible.2. Home automation linking with other devices has alot of ""growing up"" to do. The application on echo as well as the various drivers are very immature. I had difficulty pairing up to Z wave devices even though i was using a smart things hub (which is whole another disaster ...). very frustrating and unrewarding experience.3. Constant drop outs. Echo would loose internet connection when no issues existed. Mysteriously, echo would periodically loose internet connection and have to either be manually re-booted and initialize on it one. Very annoying !4. Alexa would start talking on her own, un-commanded. seems that she would repeat the last flash news or last music she was performing before being told to stop. then within an hour or so she would start up on her own.Please note that i have a 50 MB Fiber optic Internet service and run dual routers with 2.4 and 5 Ghz coverage in my house.I really wanted to like this device and build up my home automation. Both where a disappointment ! It seems that this device was not ready fro prime time. I will be looking to see of Google Home or Apple Home will be any better.","October 28, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","D Garcia","Love this little Dot!","My biggest question before buying the Dot was whether the volume was too low to use by itself, but the volume of this device is certainly substantial enough to not need an external speaker, especially if it's being used in a location where music isn't one of the top uses. I have the full-size Echo in my kitchen/downstairs area and it fills the first floor with music most of the time. The Dot is in my bedroom and is used more for information & smart home use, but is great for the morning news briefings and occasionally playing music in the mornings while getting ready for the day.When I shop on Amazon I rely heavily on other people’s reviews to help me make the right choice on what to buy and what not to buy. I depend on other people’s honesty to help me make wise choices when purchasing items here on Amazon.com. So in turn I always make sure to leave my HONEST opinions on products that I review. I try to give as much detail as I can when I can without being long winded. If you have any questions for me on something I failed to mention, please ask and I will respond quickly.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","sillieidiot","It's awesome when it works, but not ready for prime time yet.","I got this as part of a bundle deal with the Harmony remote. At first, it was pretty cool. I'm not like a seasoned user of the echo though. I didn't even know if I had a use for it, and forced myself to try to use it until it just became a habit. I had it paired up with the Harmony hub. It can only do basic things like turn on/off things and that's about it. Yes you can change channels with it, but you can't do something as simple as like pausing and stuff like that which would have been way more useful for me than changing the channels. When it works, it works great. I don't have any problems with it at it's best. But there were a couple of seething issues that they need to address, and one minor one.First, the wifi connection. This thing keeps losing connection somehow. Mines placed like 8ft away from the router and it constantly loses connection.  I have no idea how. So you have to go through the setup again. The setup sucks too, because you can't even update the Wi-Fi on the Alexa app. It always shows a blank screen. So you gotta go on your laptop to alexa.amazon.com and do it that way. At first, it dropped the connection like once every like 4 days. then it just started doing it all the time. I used to just disconnect the power and reconnect it and it would pick it up on it's own. But after awhile, that doesn't do anything. In the time that it takes to setup, I would have been finished with that I wanted it to do already. Oh yeah, the other thing about losing the Wi-Fi with the Harmony hub. You have to tell it to rediscover the devices which take like 5 mins so that it can control the hub. That's the main thing that made me fed up and I returned it.Second, the microphone issue. As with everyone, it sucks. At first, it works really well picking up like 99% of what I say. Then slowly it picks up less and less. I think I was at like 40% by the time I decided to return it. I don't know what's wrong with it. I already did the voice training and everything and the first couple of days that thing was like spot on. Couple that with the Wi-Fi disconnect, it's like first it doesn't hear you, then when it does, it's like well too bad, I'm not connected to the internet to do anything. WTF, useless.The other minor thing is the Alexa app. You can't even set up the Wi-Fi the first time because it just does the blank screen thing. If I didn't go online and search for a workaround. I would have just returned it right away. Fix your app Amazon. The only reason why I consider it minor is because you could do the setup still with your laptop.Also with the 3.5mm jack. I haven't seen anyone post this issue, but on mines. Whenever I turn off the speaker that it's connected to without taking the cable out, it stills try to send audio to it as if it were still on. So hooking it up to my amp was pointless because when the amp is off, you can't hear Alexa. I'm not going to leave it on all the time. This happens with like portable speakers and stuff too. I'm not about to disconnect the cable every time. I ended up just using alexa to turn on my amp through the Harmony hub to play music instead.All in all, it's an okay device. I would pick it up again if they could iron out those issues.

"1.0 out of 5 stars","Sean","Great first AI steps but needs improvements overall","UPDATE:  Well I have had my Dot for nearly 3 months now and I've had to give it a 1 star from previous 4 stars. My reasoning for this is simple. Alexa rarely has answers to a multitude of questions you may ask jus in daily life. She almost never hears you unless you speak overly loud and precisely. She responds to way too much stuff from things on tv ( like Commercials for Alexa/Echo or just random dialog). You'll be sitting there and she spouts off things without even being asked. Lastly, Amazon customer service on Alexa is pathetic. All you get is a lame apology and thank you for your feedback. It seems they have ZERO intention on actually making Alexa work better, just adding more useless skills. I feel there is an engineering defect since numerous reports show she does hear. So the 7 microphones are basically useless. If I could return my dot, I would. My experience has been even worse then Apples Siri, and that right there says a lot.I love interacting with Alexa. She has some issues with understanding, doesn't quite hear over normal everyday background sounds, and she has a very complicated interface. You should not have to ask Alexa to open an app first then ask her to look up the info. If amazon want a true AI experience, they need to stop with the myriad of apps and just let people ask a question. ( i.e., you have to say ' Alexa ask good housekeeping what's the best way to remove a stain.' It should just be ' Alexa how do you remove a stain '. No asking for an app, there are too many and no one can remember every app and what it does ).I have installed wemo and caseta switchs and plugs through my house and for the most part it works very very well. Just be care in naming each device something that is easily understood and not confused by another work. I found that if I name a light ' living room' and then ask Alexa to turn living room lights on, she will often say she has found several lights and I need to specify which one. So I named it just living room, leaving off 'light'. So I'll say Alexa, living room on. And she understands better.","November 21, 2016"

It is small and easily portable and the sound is just as good in my opinion as the Echo (which I have 2 of - my house is large and spread out). I decided to get the smaller Dot for my office so it would take up less space. I do find I have to speak louder to it than I do to my Echo's, which I don't necessarily like. I will try moving it and see if that helps. I did also have to rename it so that my other devices didn't all come on as well.  These are a great product, you can listen to music, the news, a book, have it tell you jokes, the weather, find out when football games are playing and who your favorite team is playing against and where, have it play a game with you, like trivia, etc the list goes on.  It is always getting smarter so who knows by the end of next year what she can do! You do have to have the internet to use thisI also bought a separate case for less than $5 to store it in if I want to take it with me somewhere, for example on a trip or to a friends house, so I don't just have to toss it in my purse.","November 5, 2016"

I bought the Phillips Hue first generation light bulb starter kit with two bulbs. I was elated at how easy it was to get everything connected. I also purchased two Wemo smart plugs and plugged my Christmas lights into it. After pairing one of them with Alexa I just say, ""Alexa, turn on Christmas lights."" And walla..... My Christmas lights come on. No more bending in awkward positions behind the tree to p,up them in. Alexa also turns on my electric blanket a half hour before I go to bed with a simple voice command. She tells me the forecast, the date, a couple really bad jokes, but cute. I just reviewed the app site where I can download more features into her. You will not regret this purchase. If you are on the fence about it, just pull the pin, you will be happy you did!!","December 6, 2016"

The speaker is like a clock radio, not the greatest, but just fine if you want quiet background music. Don't think you have to buy a Bluetooth speaker just to hear anything other than her voice. Will be buying more for other rooms! Can't wait to see what all Echo becomes in the future.","October 30, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer Jack in Tucson","We expanded our home automation cheaply with this.","We liked the first Echo Dot so much that we bought a second one for the bedroom, and immediately became addicted to listening to music to go to sleep.  This one also controls a bedroom lamp (through a Belkin bluetooth switch).  Works great, and we enjoy being able to set a timer to stop bedtime music after a time we choose and turning on and off the lamp just by asking Alexa to do it.","January 30, 2017"

Custom names would be nice, but more importantly, I would really like the ability to custom control commands.

However it doesn't know some easy answers (such as who plays Danny on Blue Bloods)  I had to ask Google on my phone and it (phone) answered correctly.  Today it heard something on my tv and said I am not sure how to help.  I have my tv and echo on in the same places, it usually doesn't do that. I was watching BBC so I don't think they used my wake word Alexa.","January 17, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","maevealleine","Skills, or mini-apps needed to access information a big negative","Smart home apps aside, Alexa is quite limited and isn't as full of information as one would expect. Her physical design is beautiful. Her voice and demeanor pleasing. However, she just didn't have all, or even most of the answers we were looking for.You will have to enable ""Skills"" which are kind of mini-apps for many of the answers Alexa will provide. For many you will need to remember an ""activation"" word that will tell Alexa which mini-app to access for information. For example, there is a Good Housekeeping skill that helps with advice on common homemaking questions and it's activation word is ""Good Housekeeping.""  You have to say, ""Alexa ask Good Housekeeping how to remove a wine stain.""  Multiply that by 100's (currently) of skills and you can see where this might become a problem. There should be no need to tell Alexa which Skill to access to get information. Her only competitor, Google Home doesn't require that and we all know why. Google is Google.Will Alexa compete, ultimately, with the oceans of knowledge Google Home provides? Unless Amazon finds some way to make Alexa much smarter without the user having to point to her where to look, I don't think so. I was saddened to find this out with our new Christmas present, Alexa. I do like her very much and she will remain in our home to, hopefully, grow and develop. Truthfully, we will also be trying Google Home. Perhaps they will talk to each other, someday.","January 7, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","P. Robichaux","The only one in my house that listens the first time I ask her to do something.","Warning: you may have a desire to replace all your light switches with Smart switches and put one of these in every room. Maybe one day...When you have 3 little girls that rarely do what you ask them to, Alexa is a dream. I use her to turn off the Christmas lights paired to a TP-link smart outlet. Also, with Amazon Music Unlimited she plays anything I was to hear. When not paired to a speaker, you can hear her just fine, although I mostly have her Bluetooth connected to a portable Bose speaker. I much prefer the Dot over the big Echo as you can pair her with any speaker you want, and she's much easier to move around the house if you want to bring her someplace else. She can hear surprisingly well even from far distances as long as she has a clear-ish line of sight even with a lot of other background noise.My only complaint is I wish she did more. I constantly find myself asking questions that she doesn't know the answer such as, ""What channel is the Wisconsin Badgers playing on tonight?"" Using a Nexus 5x and saying OK Google, usually brings up what I need as the first result, but it doesn't say it back to me. I am a bit curious if Google Home is better at answering quick questions, but I chose the Dot since it was much cheaper and integrates with Amazon Music. Hopefully Echo's get smarter as time goes on.","December 6, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Garrett Rodriguez","it sounds like playing music through your phones speaker","I was always interested in the Echo but couldn't justify the price for something I wasn't really sure about. Gave one of these a try and will end up ordering more. Takes a little bit to realize what you can do with it (reminders, alarms, news, music, control automated devices) but once I did it become something I use everyday. I hooked this unit up to an old speaker system in my living room and it was very simple to get going. On its own the built in speaker is decent, it sounds like playing music through your phones speaker. Would work well on its own in most rooms, though I highly recommend hooking it up to a speaker system in larger rooms. Alexa has no problem understanding me, unless I am playing music loud. Responses are surprisingly quick, most commands are answered in less than a second. The customizable news brief is a great way to start the day. Should be quite a few deals on the dot this holiday season so I highly recommend.","November 16, 2016"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","Kenneth E. Martin","Be Careful What You Want","The Amazon Echo Dot is a LOT of FUN. I love asking questions, and hearing silly replies. My favorite is to ask Alexa to play music by genre. I learn new artist that I hadn’t known before. I will never use the ordering ability as I am not likely to order laundry detergent, paper towels, or mouth wash. Kind of a waste here.My biggest issue is, if you want to listen to music, which is the Dot’s forte, you HAVE to pay for a Amazon Prime account. I am not going to do this.The gift I bought for my wife, an Echo Dot, is limited to answering questions that may or may not be in the Alexa database, and she is denied any ability to play music other than what she already paid for on Amazon. I wanted to keep my Amazon account separate from my wife’s, but due to that, she can’t get anything from Amazon, even though I bought this for her and set it up under her profile.So, the Dot is cool, but it is designed to make money for Amazon. (Duh) The problem is, if you buy one, and expect to get what is promised on the page, you also HAVE TO BUY a Prime account. So, Amazon pretends that there is no subscription fee for using a Dot, or any other Tap or Echo device, but bear in mind that it is not something worth buying if you are not the Prime Account Holder. It is so limited that it is worthless.Google does NOT require all of this paid membership stuff.","December 27, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Tdubl","Pretty neat with some obvious flaws","I really want to love this thing. After a month with it, it's really hit and miss. I use it to turn on and off my hue lights and it works well enough. I use it mainly for playing Spotify and it is nice to have. For the price it's hard to complain. The biggest issue with it is the voice recognition. You literally have to yell at it with music going for it to hear you. And good luck with it doing what you want or hearing you properly your first time. You'll have to try two or three times to get proper results. It also cuts out somewhat regularly while playing music which is annoying. And it can at times just stop all together and require an reboot to get working again. For a bluetooth streaming replacement.....this is somewhat hard to recommend. It's almost easier to just grab your phone and connect to your old bluetooth receiver you already own and use that (this will allow you to connect via bluetooth as well). It is nice to be able to just say next song, pause or turn volume up or down by voice commands. And good luck getting it to play a certain song out of your playlist. Much easier to just go to your phone and pick the song yourself which I resort to quite often. If you like to listen in a second zone on your stereo (like an outside patio) it can be very useful for that. I use my phone as a remote to control spotify all from within the spotify app to control the echo.  All in all, at this price it's a pretty neat gadget, but the voice recognition needs to be vastly improved to the point that you don't have to repeat yourself every other time. Pretty neat gadget if you can deal with it's annoyances, but far from perfect execution.","December 5, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Brian G.","The Amazon Echo Dot is a great product","The Amazon Echo Dot is a great product.It has so many uses and I like that it can be connected to existing audio systems (via cable or bluetooth). It is small enough to discretely fit on a shelf to where people do not even notice it. Great for the kitchen! Listen to Pandora? I heart radio? It supports both. Also love that I can get the weather by simply asking. Of course this is can be on your phone but if you are like me and do not carry your phone at all times, it is really nice to just say ""Alexa, play pandora christmas music"" and she will start playing from your linked pandora account. Or ""Alexa, how many tablespoons in a cup"" if your hands are full in the kitchen.Setup is very easy and is done in the Alexa app.Highly recommend paring it with a Philips Hue LED starter kit.A fun combination for anyone who wants to see what it is like to have your house ""connected"".Of course Alexa is not perfect. She doesn't hear everything you say and by no means does she have all the answers. But really, who does? It is a fun toy and is always getting new functionality. You do need a wireless network to configure the Amazon Echo Dot.","December 11, 2016"
"1.0 out of 5 stars","R. Lesher","Disappointed","I don't understand all the positive reviews here and the terrible reviews of the app.  We have been unable to get the device on our WiFi.  I assume this is why the app (which is used for setup) has such terrible reviews.  Also when you search for setup or WiFi connection problems on-line there are tons of instances of people unable to connect.  We have connected a multitude of devices to our network with little to no trouble.  So, I'm not sure why Amazon can't engineer a product that easily attaches to standard home WiFi networks.  I am not wasting hours of my time calling help desks and reconfiguring things.  I'm just returning this device and trying trying a competitive device.  It may be wonderful for those that can get it setup.  But, I am truly disappointed with Amazon product testing and engineering!","January 22, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Sungwoo Park","I love echo dots but with a concern about white dirt on the surface","I bought three echo dots for living room and two bedrooms. I love echo dots, now we can control all light switches (Wemo/Lifx based) and window blinds (Hunter Douglas). Plus, we can play baby lullaby with one single voice command.We have one concern about recently bought echo dots. We found white stains on the surface of all echo dots after the first day use. There were no such stain when we unwrap the echo dot from the box. I guess that some fine white dirt comes out of inside of echo dot and makes such stain on the surface. I attached photo.Does anyone have same experience after first day echo use?I am afraid this white dirt does not have any health issue because we are using it in baby's room.","December 4, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Skid Row Doc","Your home is ALIVE!","The dot has some weird bugs.  But they are all within a level of acceptability.  Wose thing is that my dot in my kitchen will often pick up my voice and respond to things I have asked my Echo in my living room even though the Dot is 30 feet further away than the Echo.... and this will often work the other way around.  It's great that they have that kind of range... but how do they determine which one answers?  I would love to be able to name them differently like, ""Kitchen Dot"" or ""Kitchen Alexa"".  I don't really like calling it Echo, because I have gotten into the habit of referring to it as ""Echo"" when I am talking about it but don't want it to respond.  And I tried calling the one in the kitchen ""Amazon"", but that didn't work well because every time my Echo said something that includes the word Amazon, (which it does frequently) the kitchen Dot would light up and say it didn't understand.  And besides, we are avid Prime users.  We have Amazon Music, Amazon Drive, Amazon everything.  We use the word Amazon too much to use it as a name.  So, my favorite thing would be to see the name choices expanded.  I'm sure they will work out the rest of the flaws.  I've already seen some fixed.  I have the Echo and 6 Dots that I bought connected through my Smartthings system.  I have 64 devices connected and my whole home is automated.  I use Alexa and Smartthings together with another app called Smarttiles (see photo) to automate my entire house.  I can control the level and color of all my lights.  I can turn on and control my TV, water heater, coffee maker, oven, computers (turn them off), signal my children to come to me, send messages, create lighting scenes, you name it.  It's all integrated with my home alarm system.  I have smart locks that unlock with a wireless keypad on the outside or by a special code message from the Alexa.  Cameras with motion sensor capabilities that can turn on lights when you enter, turn off lights and shut down vents when you leave the room.  My Nest thermostat knows when I am home and knows how to optimize my temperature.  My smartwatch lets NEST know when I am sleeping (and Smartthings) and presence sensors in my phone and on my keys (FOB) let the system know when I am home or away and sets temperature and lighting accordingly.  And when I get a few miles from my house it can warm it up or cool it down for my arrival and turn on appropriate lighting.  All of this works (nearly) flawlessly with the Echo and Dot system.","December 4, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Vincent","Amazon Echo Without The Speaker?","Yes, it's a slim down version of the Amazon Echo* without the speaker.*For this review I'm going to refer this item as the 'Dot' and the  'Amazon Echo' as the one with the speakers incorporated in the deviceIt functions exactly the same except the voice for Alexa is not as smooth (probably due to the speakers in Amazon Echo).You CAN play music on the Echo Dot without a speaker plugged in. Compared to the Amazon Echo you won't get the surround sound feature, but it's pretty decent if you're one who focus more on lyrics than instrumentals. There's an optional Aux 3mm plug in and bluetooth compatibility if you find the sound coming from the dot less sufficient and want to use an external speakerThe Echo is very portable. Fits in the palm of your hand. Love how the plug on the Dot is detachable unlike the Amazon Echo so it's easy to tranfer to a new location when you need to.Setup is very easy, just download the Alexa App and following the directions included in the box.Features wise, it's similar to Siri, Ok Google or Cortana: you can ask it questions, make shopping lists, schedule appointments, play music, set alarms, link it to Pandora/Spotify/iheartradio, see traffic updates, sports updates, news briefings, use as smart phone device, voice purchasing off amazon, among other of features. For full list of features or suggestions are present in the app and the e-mail news letter if you sign up for it.Going to go through some of the features now and what you should look out for:-Alarms: If you own multiple echo devices (Dot, Amazon Echo, and/or Amazon Tap), alarms is device specific. Good for if you have one in the master bedroom, the alarm will not go off in the child's room for example. Whatever you voice set the alarm with, it will go off on that device. Also note that the Echo devices are wifi and power dependent. If there's a blackout or if your wifi is down the alarm will not go off-Voice activation: if you own multiple echo devices and they're within the same proximity of each other, best to assign different wake words for each so both won't go off the same time. You have the option for 3 wake words: Amazon, Alexa and Echo.-Voice purchasing: look out for Alexa only deals. There are variety of discounts only offered through Alexa like how the special offers on Amazon Tablet works-Smart Home. By far the best feature in my personal opinion is the smart phone feature. You do need a smart plug or thermostat that's Alexa compatible, but it makes your life much easier by just using your voice to control the temperature or on/off the lights without having to walk up to the switch or console.Overall very good device to have around you home as it improves on your quality of life, and makes life similar if you own a smart home device. I'd get this over the Amazon Echo if you own your own high quality speakers as it's essentially the same device without the speaker. If you can chip in a little more I'd go for the upgrade as the speakers on the Amazon Echo is really good, if you want to compare it to your own home speakers I'd go check out the display demo that are available at some retail electronic stores.","November 29, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Ren88","Love it","tl;dr: Useful and fun. Definitely worth trying given the relatively low price, even if you haven't got any smart home stuff. I just wish it had a battery.I'm having a lot of fun with this so far. I haven't got any smart appliances/bulbs/etc. but there's still a lot you can do with it. If nothing else it's interesting from a user interaction perspective, and for the price I'd say it's worth getting one just to have a new experience. The assistant on your phone can do a lot of the same things in terms of setting alarms and telling the weather, but having something controlled entirely by voice has a different feel to it, and Alexa seems more personable and natural to interact with. Once you have the right skills enabled it actually tells you what you want to know instead of just pulling up a web search. The range on the mic makes it really convenient to set timers when you're working out or cooking, and you can even set the alarm to have the guys from Grand Tour wake you up which is pretty amusing. On a more practical note, I think being able to control everything with your voice could be really helpful for people who have vision or mobility difficulties.A big part of the reason I got it was to help motivate me to work on programming, and after playing with it for a few hours I can't wait to try making a skill. I was always told that learning goes a lot better if you have a project to work toward, and this is great for that.The only thing I wish is that it had a battery. I assumed it did, and that plugging it in was just to charge, but it needs external power at all times. I'm planning to get a USB battery pack for mine.","November 27, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","ROssy","Our newest household friend","I was on the fence about buying one of the Echo Dot's but I always do a family gift for Christmas at my house and I decided this year, this would be it. I'm really glad I did. We've only been using Alexa and the dot for 2 days but I feel like I've already gotten my $$ worth out of her. We didn't have a radio hooked up in our house, I know right, get with the times. For just the music alone it's worth the buy! I love that she's able to hear me no matter what room I'm in on the floor of the house we have her in. She's understood what I've asked every single time. I love the ability to get the latest news, weather, and more in an instant. I love that I'm able to set alarms, reminders, and even order via the dot. (Although I've not done this yet, I did set a passcode. It worried me that my toddler could purchase things if he wanted!) Which brings me to the fact that she even understands my 4-year old. He's asked her to play some of his favorite songs and she does, right away. I am an android user and I thought ""I don't need this, we have google and it does everything this alexa does!"" Which is true, but I am so glad we have this now. I'm not sure if I would have preferred one of the bigger models or not, but this has great sound and works very well. My only regret is that I didn't buy one for every floor of my house. I'm excited to start purchasing some of the items that will work throughout our house so she can really be helpful!","December 26, 2016"

Now if only Next up when budget allows will be a Logitech Harmony - wifi to IR to control the apple tv, dvd player etc. Alexa Channel 5. Alexa pause movie. Now if only I could find inexpensive light controls. Alexa Night mode! Someday.Oh, and Alexa is really awesome at picking music for me, I've listened to a bunch of new artists and the idea of needing to work on a playlist is vanished. Alexa Music! And so easy to Alexa Skip or Alexa Thumbs Up. Five Stars - but would give 10 if I could.P.S. I gave some thought to purchasing Echo instead but had some speakers so went with the dot. I'm glad I did. Not only less expensive I've found that sometimes Alexa can struggle hearing the wake up word if the speakers are close and loud so I plan on keeping the dot at a bit of distance from the speakers. The Dot is fabulous at hearing the wake up word over the tv and managed well even when I had a cold..","December 5, 2016"

When I ask the dot something it rarely answers but the Echo in the other room does answer.  When the Dot finally does answer it says it has lost its connection.  I have tried it in various locations, all of which have great WiFi, have reset it, but it still does not work. App shows it online at all times.  Mine must be defective. I see a lot of refurbished ones so suspect many are being returned defective.  Maybe wait until 3rd generation?","November 5, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","M. Sims","Alexia; A welcome addition to the family!","When I first heard of the new and improved Alexa Dot, I knew I had to have her in our kitchen!  When she was delivered a few weeks ago, it was like Christmas!  I'm a geeky/techy type woman so having her in my house was exhilarating.  She tells us the weather, the news, but I find we use her more to listen to Pandora (which is free).  I simply say; Alexa, play Pandora, and she responds that she will play my last channel.  Its really great to hear the teens get into it and talk to her and ask her to ""Turn up the volume"", and ask her trivia questions.  For $49.00, it was such a fun and great investments.  What's better is that additions to what she can do is added to her so she's not stuck where she was when first introduced or purchaased.  There are still things I need to learn to do, like 1) Learn to operate her from my cell or computer instead of physically being in the room (not sure if its possible, but will find out) 2) Learn to change the News Flash to WTOP so my husband can call up the news and traffic before leaving for work.  Overall, you cannot go wrong with Alexa, the thing is remembering she's there and using her.  Sometimes I honestly forget she's there.  I would recommend you get her in White if your appliances or surroundings are black.  This way she stands out more.  She's in our kitchen sitting on the computer stand which blends in too well. I have attached a pic of her in our kitchen. :-)","December 9, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","p. annoyed","Get this instead of the full price Amazon Echo.","To me, this is a much better option than the much more expensive Amazon Echo.  First, for the price, we bought 3 for less than the cost of one of the more expensive version.  One for the living room, one for our bedroom, and one for the family room.  We then connected it through Bluetooth to our soundbar in the living room, which gives a much better music experience than the full price echo would.  Downstairs, we connected it with a audio video cable to our surround sound system, and in the bedroom, we don't really listen to music, so we didn't bother hooking it up to a speaker.  Even if you don't have a speaker already, you can buy a much higher quality bluetooth speaker for about $100 on sale, so you are still coming out cheaper and will have a better sound experience.  Also, being that this is already the second generation of the Echo, I feel like they will continually come out with new versions, so why would you want to spend a ton of money on a speaker that is going to be obsolete.","November 26, 2016"

Attempted every troubleshooting suggestion many times, Dot failed to connect to WiFi and defaulted to the red ring.

Then passed to another person, who insisted (in broken english) going through trouble shooting.  Error code presented in the ap was never found as far as I can tell.  After 97 minutes on the phone the technician sent an email with a return label.  The email containing the label never appeared in my email (refreshed many times).  I was instructed to restart my browser, and then restart my computer so the email would go through....and later was told the email would appear in the next 24 hours...email never arrived.

Paying less does not mean the quality has been compromised, its amazing. You can literally shout from opposite end of a large room and Alexa will light up ready to take orders from you. The best part is your integration with amazon music, amazon shopping, shopping lists etc. I extensively use amazon music. All my playlists and favorites are not just a voice command away.I never thought I would use it to this extent. I never imagined the voice recognition would be so accurate. I am so amazed by the product, I am actually getting some other compatible devices like lights and switched today. It would be wonderful to ask Alexa to turn of lights and other electronics. I hate switching off lights in the night after I have settled in my blanket.For anyone who likes advanced technology, this is as close as you can get to AI for this price. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I mean 50$ for this level of automation and technology is just ridiculous. I get her to do my news briefing every day. I play music every day. Another great thing is connects to any other Bluetooth device with a voice command. I had PC speakers of really good build just lying around. So I permanently hooked them up with my tap, and it works so well. I have a bluetooth speaker in my dressing room which is a bit far away and with one command, it starts playing music in that one instead of the ones I hooked it up with. I am so excited for my lights and switched. This is one of the best investments I have ever made. If you are looking at reviews to see if you should buy one or not, JUST GO FOR IT. you will not regret it.","October 26, 2016"

There are still some questions which Alexa is not programed to answer (I suppose it has to do with which search engine answers are pulled).  However, my Echo Dot is wonderful.  Within minutes I was comfortable with her and my voice was easily recognized (repeatedly).  I enjoy the positive and supportive apps. I give it 5stars because it does just what I want it to do, when I want it to do it.  The Echo Dot has picked up my voice from across a master bedroom and she has picked up my gentle whisper in the morning. I am most pleased with how easy it is for me to put something on my calendar and to know it syncs with google calendar.  I plan on taking full advantage of the shopping and to-do-list as this will support me since I often forget what to do and get. I am amazed at how well it works, I foresee Amazon making even better strides with it. I have never used technology which provides responses and information as fast as it does.Since the Echo Dot doesn't work on battery it always has to be plugged in.  There is nothing it can do if the power is out. However, this is probably a suitable time to enjoy solitude anyway. Gratitude Amazon Engineers for this amazing and useful gadget.","December 28, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Mike S.","I am satisfied with it","These are (in my opinion) very handy, and has more and more functionality being added all the time.  I have one ""regular"" echo unit that I mainly play music on in a bedroom, and use the dot down in the living room to do things like update a grocery list, turn lights on and off (which you will need to have some kind of smart plug like the TP link smart plugs to do), get weather and traffic updates etc.I see them as being as useful as you want them to be.  The echo does most everything through skills you enable through the Alexa app, or tell the echo to enable directly.  Some of the skills that can be enabled are pretty useless or just for fun, but others like the alert my buddy app (which can alert a list of people you need help) can be very useful for people with medical conditions that may incapacitate their ability to move easily, or seniors at risk of falling. Some things, like acting as a timer or alarm, playing musing in your Amazon library, accessing Wikepedia,  or checking on your Amazon delivery status etc you do not need to enable a skill to do. That it can do on its own.I have found that it responds to and understands commands most of the time very well.  It mainly only has problems when there is background noise like from a TV.  Occasionally it will understand a question just fine, but not know the answer.  You can check the app to see what it heard, and give it feedback on whether it did what you wanted it to in response.It is definitely not something that everyone will find useful or see as a must have.  But if you have seen the commercials or looked into it and are intrigued by at least some of the things it can do, then I definitely think it (the dot especially) is worth the price.  You do not need to have the more expensive echo unit for the dot to work.  It is its own unit and can do all the things the echo can do, the only difference as far as I can tell is that the ""regular"" echo is a better speaker than the dot.  The speaker output is pretty tinny compared to the more expensive echo unit.  You can play Pandora or iheart radio on the dot and it sounds fine, but I do not think the sound is as good on the dot as it is on the regular echo unit.The setup is very easy.  I know some reviewers had a very hard time getting it set up, but I did not encounter that at all.  You just download the Alexa App to your phone or tablet.  Plug the echo into the wall and use the app to configure it.  Basically you have to connect it to WiFi (which it did for me very quickly and without a problem) and then read through a list of about 25 commands to configure it to your voice.  All in all it takes about 15 min to get it set.","November 24, 2016"

My one concern is how much money I want to spend on smart home devices now. I keep thinking how fun custom lighting might be... or how about thatSome things I do with my Alexa:- Order things on Amazon. This is both dangerous and exhilarating. I worry it might make impulse buying too easy, but so far so good. I love that I can tell her to order C batteries and they come two days later. Gone are the days of running out of a household item and forgetting to go online to re-order for days/weeks.- Play music. We got Amazon Unlimited and I got rid of my Spotify account. We have yet to find a song Alexa can't play. Sometimes you need to try a few times to remember the name of the song, but that is mostly user error.- Nighttime white noise machine. I'm a light sleeper, but I quickly realized that Alexa can soothe my sleep by playing waves or any other white noise on  Amazon Unlimited. I've created a few sleepy time playlists, and at bet time I say ""Alexa, play my sleepy time playlist on loop"" and she'll play it until I tell her to stop in the morning.- Alarm clock. Okay this one is pretty lazy, but I no longer need to push a button on my phone to ask Siri to do it.- Comic relief. She tells some funny jokes! And she has some great easter eggs.

Commanding Alexa to control the thermostat is NOT very natural, and you have to MEMORIZE the lines. For example, ""Alexa, TELL THE THERMOSTAT that I am going away"" would work 2 out of 5 times, and why can't I just say ""Alexa, set the thermostat to away"". Sometimes if I say, ""Alexa, ask the thermostat about the setting"" versus ""Alexa, ask the thermostat what the setting is"" I get two different results.- Sometimes it would just turn the FAN on because the device did not hear me correctly.- There is little to no integration with IOS/iPhone unless I do with through IFTTT- I feel like the voice command of the iPhone (Siri) is way better than Alexa.- EDIT: Yesterday, I just asked alexa maybe 2-3 times to set my NEST/Thermostat to away and she couldn't understand what my voice command was and she turned red and said something like ""connection was lost"" or something to that effect. I am experiencing this more and more. It was frustrating.- EDIT: If she doesn't understand my voice command, there's no feedback. She would just not say anything back.Overall I think the voice recognition and command needs A LOT of improvement.","December 28, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Dan","Simply Amazing!","I've kept my eye on the Amazon Echo ever since it came out.  However, for a person that owns a home, it only makes sense that you would want one in almost every room.  Buying a handful of Echos at $180 would have been too much of an investment for me.  So I sat and waiting for a better solution.  Then this new 2nd Generation Echo Dot came out for $50.  This was more of the solution I was looking for, so I purchased several of them.Installing them and setting them up was a  breeze.  The clarity/quality of the internal speaker really surprised me.  I wasn't expecting that kind of sound from such a small package.  Also, if you have a couple of rooms where you want even better sound, you can just plug in a couple of amplified stereo speakers (I will most likely do this in my living room).I have Samsung Smartthings Hub (for home automation) and Logitech Harmony Hub (for video/audio automation), so my ultimate goal was to be able to walk through my home; turning on/off lights as I enter/exit rooms simply by speaking a simple command.  I also wanted to be able to just speak to control my TV, Roku & Amp.  This new Echo Dot does this flawlessly.  Though I've only had these installed for about a week, they have performed admirably and help to complete my home automation project.The Dot has several internal microphones.  These microphones are very sensitive.  If the room is quiet, I can almost whisper from across a 20' room and the Dot will accurately receive what I said.  If there are other audio sources playing at the time (like a loud TV), you do need to speak up, so that the Dot can recognize that you are trying to communicate with it, and that it isn't just the TV.  This is to be expected, and short of the Dot having a camera that constantly has it's eye on you to visually recognize a command spoken to it, you will need to speak a little louder than the other sources playing.The Echo has many application add-ins known as 'skills' that you can add.  There are over 1,000 of them, and that list continues to grow.  However, many people don't know that a lot of power is added to the Echo by use of IFTTT.com.  Until Echo gets a Logitech Harmony skill, you will need to use IFTTT to control the Logitech Harmony from an Echo.I also like the size of the Dot.  I wanted small devices that I could add to my rooms and hide, so that no one would know where the voice was coming from.  This not only makes the room more aesthetically pleasing, but guests are always trying to figure out where Alexa's voice is coming from.  It makes your smart home just a little bit cooler.There are many fun things you can do with the Echo.  You can add games to it, have it look up movie trivia, local business information, give you the time, add wake up alarms, set timers, etc...  This said, for $50, this is just about the highest value in electronic devices you can buy.  Besides it being a great value though, the Amazon Echo Dot also makes your life easier.","October 25, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Syngen","Buy Dots not Echos!","Get a Dot, not an Echo. A Dot will pair with Bluetooth speakers and you will get the sound quality you probably expect, even if you're only a causal listener to music like myself. Audiophiles may want $200 speakers but $50 ones worked for me. The Dot is a recorder of your voice to follow commands and not really a speaker. The Echo has a tinny speaker that is difficult to understand when it talks and music is just OK, even for someone like me who is not an audiophile.You can download the Alexa phone app to set it up but you will find yourself less frustrated if you use the Amazon Alexa Home website. The app is so slow and sluggish it took three tries before I could complete the tasks fast enough before the Echo or Dot went out of setup mode.I would purchase 2 Dots before buying an Echo and Dot. It's cheaper and you will like the fact that the Dot can pair with Bluetooth speakers. The Echo can't, so you have to listen to a speaker that is frankly annoying and garbled.","December 11, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Gadget Guy","Great product!!  Plan to buy a few more!","A few months ago, I struggled with getting the Amazon Alexa. I wanted it but didn't want to pay $179 for it.  About a week into deciding to get one. I found out the 2nd generation Dot was being released in October for $50. I couldn't pre-order one fast enough. The pre-order release date was October 20th but my delivery date was Oct 26-29th. So I waited patiently until on October 22, a few of my friends that had also pre-ordered, started receiving their Dot. I guess because they were Prime members, they got it faster.  I stumbled across Best Buy website and found out that their stores had them in stock.  So I canceled my pre-order with Amazon and ordered my Dot online at Best buy and picked it up later that evening.This is a great little gadget!  I love it!  I use it to turn my TV on and off. Its great to add items to your shopping list as you run out of things. Its also great when you want to hear music as it pulls songs from either your Iheart radio, Pandora, Spotify or Amazon account. Simply speaking your request.  I've stood about 12-15 feet away in my bathroom, with the water running and it still responds.  Its pretty witty as well. ""Alexa, good night""and it responds ""good night sweet dreams.Set up took about 10 minutes. All of my friends who visit now want one. Even the ones that are non tech types.  I plan to get a few more Dots to put around the house as well as add some wifi light bulbs and outlets.  As a kid I used to watch Star Trek and dream about these gadgets. Now Its pretty cool to actually be able to use them in your home.","October 27, 2016"
"1.0 out of 5 stars","JD in Rochester","Lack of sound quality from its own speaker, from blutooth and wired","I already have both Echo and Tap. They are great products with sound quality beyond belief for their size. Echo is the best and has the Alexa trigger word. Tap does everything Echo does except no trigger word - you need to push a button to talk to Alexa - however, the advantage is that it is portable and operates on it's internal battery anywhere in the house. That brings us to Dot - it is the only one that has the ability to provide audio output to an external sound system. I planned to connect to my stereo either via its blutooth or output jack connection. I knew that the smaller box would sound tinny, but thought that the audio would be acceptable if patched through to a good quality stereo. Wrong. The audio that Dot sends sounds just as tinny through the stereo as it does through its own tiny internal speaker. I would liken it to a small transistor radio from the 1960's.So, my Dot might get sent back until there is something that meets this need and performs as I would expect. Or, this Dot may sit in the kitchen to more easily have Alexa add things to my shopping list - with the poor sound quality, it is good for little else than that.","November 25, 2016"

No matter where I am in my house now, one of my ""Digital wives"" as I refer to Alexa... can hear me.Pros:This new echo is smaller, lighter, and far less expensive than the original, including the original dot.  It is well built, feels sturdy, has loud volume, and seems to function well.  Even in the parts of my house where I am really stretching wifi, due to distance.With our audible subscription, and with a healthy supply of several children's books that we have purchased over the years, each of my kids can have a personal assistant read them to sleep each night.  Which is nice.  They each pick whatever story they want, from The Cat In The Hat, to Harry Potter, to Jane Austen, and listen to a book as they fall asleep.  They are getting very adept at asking her to read their favorite book.She is also great help for homework.  She explains things they don't understand, looks up endless random facts, and is much quicker than a calculator would be.  She is an excellent ""digital mother.""  (Again, a joke... sort of...)I find myself getting frustrated with the appliances that don't yet work with Alexa.  ""You mean, I have to actually lift my hand and push a button!  I can't just ask Alexa to do it!!  That is sooo last year!!!""It is small, unintrustive, out of sight, yet always there whenever I say her name, and ask her to do something.My favorite is ""Alexa Trigger I love Anna.""  I have this setup to email my wife that I love her, text her that I love her, and flash all the lights in the house pink several times!Cons:As much as I love my digital wife she is not quite perfect.  She has her quarks and her flaws.Only one person can use her at a time:Amazon added a new feature with this release to account for the fact that multiple Echos can hear me throughout the house.  This is nice in that it ensures that only one echo ever responds when I ask her for help.  However, an unintentional consequence is that with nine of us in the house constantly turning things on and off, and asking her questions, we have quickly learned  that only one person can ask a question at a time.  If my son across the house is talking to Alexa, I can't.  She will ignore me.  It is fine once he is done making his request.  ie, if he starts a book.  Once the book is actually playing I can then  make my request.  However while he is actually talking, she will only listen to him.  I can't engage her on any other echo in the house.This has been annoying on multiple occasions!  They need to allow me to setup which Echos are close to each other, and which are far apart, so that the far away ones can operate independently.  Another option would be to program her to recognize voices, and distinguish between requests coming from different people.Can't make multiple requests:I should be able to say ""Alexa turn on the fan and the lights"" or ""Alexa play music and set the volume to 8""  Instead I have to separate each request into its own sentence, ""Alexa turn on the fan.""  Then wait then ""Alexa turn on the lights.""My kids can turn my bedroom lights on and off:This is probably the most annoying thing about our setup.  My kids can say ""Alexa trigger Dad's lamp"" and cause my lamp to turn on and off.  There needs to be a way to restrict certain skills to certain alexas.  ie, when I walk into one room I shouldn't have to say ""Alexa turn on living room lights.""  I should instead be able to say ""Alexa turn on the lights"" and have it know that I am in the living room based on which echo heard my request.  Likewise I should be able to block access to certain lights or features on specific echos that are in other rooms.All in all though we love the technology, and will continue to invest in it.  Amazon has already made many improvements, and I have no doubt that they will make many more!","October 24, 2016"

I love my ECHO .. but this DOT is something completely different.  Last night after ignoring a question .. it just rebooted.  Spend the money on an ECHO .. it never fails!","November 20, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Diavolo57","Right on the Dot","Ok, so I wouldn't say I'm a pro at the Dot, navigating Alexa, or any of that just yet because this is my first ""echo"" device and I only got it a few days ago.  Maybe I'll come back and write a more in-depth review after I've had it for a few weeks/months.  Now that I've laid down the origin of my review I must say I'm really happy with it.  It's real easy to set up, just like up to your wifi, download the app, and set her up.  I've always liked the concept of the echo but dropping $180 on one turned me off, then the dot came out.  It can essentially do everything the Echo can for about $130 less AND it can hook up to bluetooth speakers...The echo cannot.  Granted the Echo has a better built in speaker from what I'm told but it can't be linked up to other bluetooth speakers, but the Dot can with bluetooth or audio cable...I haven't actually used this feature because I'm pretty happy with the speaker the Dot currently wields, it's not bad. It's clear and it can get loud, maybe if your having a party you might want to link up to a bigger sound systems but for lounging around at home it's perfect.The skills are easy to obtain through the alexa app, as I've only had it for a few days I really haven't explored much of what alexa has to offer but I've been satisfied with the responses I got from the questions I asked.  I've basically asked her about the weather (I learned the Big Sky skill, which gives a much more detailed weather forecast and I recommend it), traffic, news, how to make certain cocktails, music, random facts, tell me a joke, silly stuff like that...It's fun...and the fact that it was only $50 makes it even better.  Regardless, she understands me pretty clearly, there are I believe, 7 microphones in it, and when you talk to it the blue light on it will also indicate where it's picking up your voice which is neat. I also heard there are some cool Star Wars/Star Trek/Game of Thrones Easter eggs that I want to try out (like say Beam me up, or winter is coming or something like that).  Another interesting feature is that the app records all the interactions you've had with alexa. For instance, I asked her how to make a Tom Collins cocktail, and I looked on the app and she had the recipe there along with the other questions/interactions I had with it.The only issue I've had was that every once in a while alexa will come on out of now where and say ""I'm sorry I didn't understand that,"" however, I think it's because I placed the dot right next to the TV... I plan on moving it to the kitchen where there might not be as much noise. Overall though, I'm happy with it, and for $50 you can't go wrong.","October 24, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Mark Gordon","Great device, especially when paired with smart home devices, worth the money","What can I say about the Echo Dot? I got several of these on sale so that they were about half price, and for that price they were a no-brainer. One is in my living room and one is in the bedroom, and at the same time I also purchased a number of the Phillips Hue bulbs, which I also found on sale.Now most of the lights in my home are controlled by the Echo. It is very nice to walk inside and be able to say ""turn on lights."" And have the lights come on. You can also set various levels of dimness by voice, which is great while watching television.Echo also allows you to stream music from your Amazon prime account, and it's super easy. You just say ""Echo, play some Taylor Swift."" And the Echo will play Taylor Swift.Another very useful feature is setting alarms and timers. We use this a lot while cooking. You just say, ""Echo, set a timer for 12 minutes."" Or if you want to set an alarm, just say, ""Echo, set an alarm for 9:30 AM.""You can also stream news and radio stations very easily.Echo can give you the weather information for today, or for a week, and in any location that it can recognize. Not every world city is in its database, but most major cities are. ""Echo, what is the weather in London?""I also hooked Echo up to a TP link smart switch, which my coffee maker is plugged into. At night I load up water and coffee into the maker, and in the morning, from the comfort of my bed, I can say ""Echo, turn on coffee."" By the time I'm actually awake and up the coffee is made.As you might have already figured out, I love my Echo. Even though there's nothing that it does that couldn't be done via a smart phone and some smart switches, it just seems like controlling things with voice is so much easier. You don't have to find your phone, and you don't have to mess with it. You just talk.I'm not sure though that I would be so ecstatic about the Echo if I hadn't also invested in the smart lightbulbs and smart switch. The Echo alone is primarily useful for listening to music (you can plug in a better external speaker or connect any Bluetooth speaker), for getting the weather or news, and for setting timers and alarms. You can also integrate various to do list apps with the Echo, and add to do items or shopping list items by voice.Finally, you can ask your Echo to tell you jokes. They are very corny jokes, but it's still fun.","December 27, 2016"
"1.0 out of 5 stars","Robert P.","WOULD GIVE 5 STARS, BUT DISCOVERED A POTENTIAL PRIVACY/SECURITY FLAW IN MY 2ND GEN DOT.","In a nutshell, I recently learned these devices are permitting anonymous Bluetooth connections from untrusted/anonymous phones.  The Dot does NOT need to be placed in ""pairing"" mode for this to occur as observed personally about a week ago. Additionally, it allows a user to ""stream"" music or content through the device and connected speakers.  There are potentially other risk involved with this flaw, but at this time, it's unclear how they may be exploited.","December 19, 2016"

I would not pay full price ($50 pre-tax) for it with the technology in its current stage. I can’t do with it most of what I wanted to, and it doesn’t work as well as I thought it would.Examples:1. I thought, for instance, I could control the Fire TV (for instance tell it to play something on it), but you can’t do that.2. The device gets disconnected from the internet frequently in an area of the house I have good reception in and never had any problems.3. Related or unrelated to it, TuneIn Radio barely works (at least with my stations) from the dot, but if I put my phone at the same place and play from it, it works perfect.4. The speech recognition captures about 75% of what I say, but I have a slight accent so maybe that’s an issue.","November 12, 2016"

"1.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","Fall short of expectation; for now, take a good look at Google Home","1. Even though it claims to use Big search engine; for simple searches, most of the time, it will just tell you to look at your phone to have it follow a link that it puts in the  Alexa app.2. It claims that it can link via Bluetooth to play your music from, but you are not told that you can not do searches. To be able to do this, you need to pay Amazon 7.99 a month to play your own music library (you have to upload your music to their cloud and only the first 250 songs are free).3. Simple functions like: ""Alexa, how to you say cat in Spanish"" does not work. You have to add a skill and then say ""Alexa, ask translator to say cat in Spanish"". Since Amazon claim that Alexa uses Bing, if I go to Bing and ask the same question, I get a correct response.4. Look at Google offering, Google Home. This is a good example of what the Echo should be able to do (or at least half), and at the time of this review, it has been only out for less then a week and Echo has been out for two years.","November 10, 2016"
"2.0 out of 5 stars","C. Elsasser","It is an amazon buying machine","As with the fire I quickly became frustrated with the echo because of the degree to which it nurtures purchases of product and services within amazon.  I also found that it very frequently was unable to answer my queries.  And the were not elaborate queries.  For a small subset of queries it did an impressive job.  And it is good at telling the time and weather.  Spotify integration is terrible: doesn't find artists, doesn't find playlists, cannot rate songs playing, cannot tell what is playing (at times), plays samples of amazon prime music content and then asks if I want to subscribe to amazon prime music (as with audible and prime, etc) when I am not a subscriber.I am sending it back and am going to try Google Home.  I don't know whether it will be any better, but happily they sell FAR less than amazon does so the feedback (to the store) possibilities don't exist like they do with amazon.","October 29, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Greg Hallock","Inexpensive and surprisingly useful, could find a niche in most homes.","I have both the first and 2nd gen Dots. They're surprisingly versatile devices.  Want an alarm clock with no persistent lights at all? It does that.  Want voice control over your lights, thermostat, music, or kitchen fire alarm? With the right devices, it does that.Need a joke? Alexa has a few decent ones, and quite a few stinkers.While the speaker in the Dot is tiny, tinny, and mediocre at best, it is sufficient for everyday interactions, or for music if you aren't picky.  If you ARE picky, it can output audio through a headphone jack or Bluetooth. And the audio quality output to my 20 year old Bose Mediamate speakers is very good.  And being able to deal with my music hands free while cooking or otherwise occupied is very useful.All of that would have gotten 5 stars for me. After all, this is a $50 device, and very very good at what it does. But to really put it over the top, you have the easter eggs.  Alexa knows who Shot First.  Alexa knows GlaDos though they have drifted apart. Alexa does not think that word means what I think it does. Alexa knows it is a trap, and is taking evasive action. And Alexa Sings Happy birthday.And as an added bonus for gamers, the dot can roll virtual dice, and flip coins.  Simply say ""roll 47d20"" and it will do so, and read off the results.","November 9, 2016"

With the echo, I have any form of trouble at all, and it immediately jumps in, interrupts me, and tells me it couldn't understand me.  The, I have the immense irritation to have to say everything again.  I pretty much cannot use it, because when there is any form of gap in my speech, it just assumes I'm done.I just wish it was able to be a bit more tolerant.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Hugh K.","A fun little experiment","I have to be honest. I was skeptical of this device. It seemed like a gimmick without much utility--at best a fun little toy for my kids. Living with this diminutive gizmo for the past couple weeks, however, I've come to find a number of its available features useful, and well, fun.The PotentialThe future potential for this device becomes evident once you start using it, and come to rely on its convenience of use. For instance, you can ask for a forecast, the time of day, and my favorite, set a timer (comes in handy for doing stretches, yoga, what have you). Its draw is that it's fast and convenient: instead of having to fidget with your smart phone you simply give Alexa the command. It only took a few times before getting used to telling the Echo to turn on a music station on Amazon Prime. Now I use this feature daily to listen to music (so my house is more often filled with music as a result).There are already a lot of available ""skills"" you can enable on your Alexa, and the list is growing all the time. One function I am looking forward to is Alexa to be able to control my Roku through voice commands. There is a hack for this found on GitHub (*UPDATE*: see the attached video - I just implemented it using the code on GitHub with a little bit of modification), but I wish Alexa had this function built-in. Since Roku is the hub of all my streaming it would be convenient to be able to tell Alexa to start an app and search for a title to watch. I know I could use the Roku remote to do voice commands, but I do not use it in favor of a universal remote. This would be an incredibly useful feature for Alexa (without having to spring for something like the Harmony Hub for another 100 bucks or so).The Pros-The main pro for this device is how affordable it is. I honestly would not have bought it to play with it if it cost more than 50 bucks. At this price it's almost an auto purchase for someone like me who simply wanted to play around with it and experience it for myself.-The voice trigger -- the so-called ""far field"" mic -- is sensitive. The Dot was able to listen to my commands from a different room with no line of sight to it, from about 18 feet away.-Echo's brain lives online, so the local unit doesn't need to have hefty specs, and I imagine would not need to be upgraded often -- all the learning and improvements takes place at its central servers, your Dot simply serving as the gateway to all that is offered and will be in the future.The Cons-I have my Echo Dot connected to my main home theater receiver (through the 3.5mm jack). I wish I could tell Echo to connect to a Bluetooth speaker located in another room. This is not possible currently if you have it connected through the 3.5mm port since that takes precedence. However, I believe you could pair with multiple Bluetooth speakers (not multicast, but one at a time) if you solely use the Bluetooth to connect.-Alexa speaks okay for a robot of today, but the machine reading in general could use some improvement. Often some words are jumbled together when Alexa is saying them to where it becomes unintelligible.-A small nitpick but I wish I could name my Echo its own name of my choosing. So instead of having only 3 trigger names to choose from (Amazon, Alexa, or Echo) I can customize my own.Overall, Echo Dot is a good purchase if you want to experiment with setting up your home to become ""smart."" At its current price it's definitely worth a try. Plus my kids love it, ""Echo, ask for a fart,"" is their current favorite ""skill."" Gets them laughing every time.","November 4, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Bernie C.","Bad value, not smart enough","Alexa is surprisingly limited in what it can do out of the box. Many commands I try, which should be intuitive, are not available. For example, Alexa is unable to perform ""Alexa, set an alarm titled 'call your mother' for 10am""Siri can do this without a problem. In fact, I've found Siri to be a lot smarter. Siri can build off of your last command, and can make phone calls which is awesome.I considered returning this but ultimately kept it because my wife enjoyed checking the weather hands free. I found it to be poor value for $50 but I hope it can get smarter quickly.","December 2, 2016"

It works fantastic. I use a Honeywell thermostat that connected very easily. I converted my old Bose Sound Dock with a bluetooth gadget and now use it with Alexa everyday!

My home already has nice sound, the price of the echo was just not in my electronics budget at this time.  I was very excited when I found the Dot, and for the price, I had to give it a go.  I've only had it for about a week now, but we love it (her).  Many Easter eggs built in, and just asking her to play a song, a group, or genre and have her do it is delightful.  Right now, she's hooked up to my Denon through a 3.5mm jack, but the Denon doesn't offer bluetooth.  I'm working on adding a bluetooth HDMI adapter.  As for automation, I am a bit of a tinkerer when it comes to gadget and cool stuff, so I went on several hunts when Alexa arrived to our home.  From what I can tell, if you're looking to automate (lights, thermostat, etc), you will most likely need a hub.  At first, I thought I'd need several hubs to support different manufacturers devices.  Seemingly, not so.  The Samsung SmartThings hub ($50 on Amazon right now) not only has support for most device manufacturers, but also has (and the coolest part for me) open source platform (Amazon also has open source).  What this means is, like Android, anyone can develop ""skills"" (Amazons name for an app or program).  The market is going to flood with new skills and devices from people like me who love building tech.  So, like I said, there probably isn't much I can say about the Dot that hasn't been said, but there is much to be said for the Alexa environment.p.s., the microphones (7 of them) are amazing.  She can hear me from a good distance.","November 22, 2016"

First off I find it incredibly handy with my wifi lighting and even bought a tplink wifi power outlet that now i dont have to crawl under my xmass tree to shut it off.  The radio is so perfect for the holidays and in general.Its loudest volume isnt going to boom but it will be clear and you will have to speak over to another person but alexa will still hear you really well.  I have used it numerous times now to make sure im not late with clock and timers and it also keeps me up on my deliveries and even pizza.  overall they are just beginning to get this device going.  It is capable of so much more.  The microphones are supposed to determine which one you are closest too for where the command will execute which is nice.  Be careful of echoey spots like the bathroom as that often tricks it in thinking you are closer.NOW for the wish list.One thing I didslike is I cant control other dots from another.  When the other room accidentally starts playing music you can tell all rooms to stop. I have 5 echoes.  Also I would like to turn on music on every device too so that I dont have different songs playing in different rooms/  There needs to be some continuity.Now my biggest pet peave is appliance awareness.  Using a common term like turn off lights should note which dot is hearing it and execute that command for the lights you specified near that dot.  This does not exist.  You current have to tell it which lights to turn off.How is there no phone calling possible through this excellant speaker and mic.  Also a builtin find your phone feature via bluetooth would be cool so if it is closest to one dot and has a stronger signal it could tell you which room its in.I recommend these despite the wish list.  I have seen daily headaches dissappear wtih all my connected devices and I really like it in conjunction with the Logitech Harmony remote works pretty well but there needs to be more detailed added to that skill.","December 10, 2016"

Beware if you have any devices over a couple years old because the Alexa app that is required to run the Dot will only work on newer devices.Alexa would install on my iPad but not my iPhone or my Samsung Galaxy tab. it will install on my wifes year old Kindle fire device but my wife is not interested in the Dot at all but uses her Fire to browse Facebook or shop on Amazon.Older Kindle Fires will not work.My problem now (along with thousands of others) is that the new Dot keeps dropping its network assignment..it says nothing when the connection is lost but will tell you through the  Alexa  app the next time you try you try to use the device. I have fiber-optic cable to my house and my router is an ASUS RT-AC1900. Both Dots were 18 feet from the router and they keep telling me that I have Internet problems. COME ON. Looks like i will need to spend another three or four hours on-line to tech support or maybe buy a dedicated T-1 line to maybe get this working. If you have one and it is working fine then bless you. I you are considering buying one yourself then be sure all of your other tech that must run the Alexa app is up to date or buy a new phone or tablet that is on their list also.Right now all I have is an mp3 player that must be reset every hour. If it wasn't a gift it would be right back to Amazon. The Dot is not ready for prime timeThis is an update to my previous review - I have moved it everywhere possible and it will still not stay connected. You can re run the setup program and the Dot 2 will disconnect within minutes. My verdict is that the DOT sucks as well as customer service. There are no help links on the Dot page and Echo Dot customer service links are well hidden. If you do happen to get customer service, they do not speak English well enough to understand you and seem to be reading all of their instructions to you from a written script.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Argh","It can't hear me.","I think mine is defective. When there is any ambient noise in the room - anything from a sizzling frying pan to low playing music - it can't hear me. I can literally put my face right in it, and yell, and it doesn't respond. It's excruciatingly frustrating. My Echo does *not* do this. I'm returning it with the hopes that the replacement actually works.***Update: 12.29.16: I received a replacement Dot. It still has difficulty hearing me, but it isn't nearly as bad as the first one. If an audio book or music is playing, it still can't hear me over it - even if the sound is coming from the Bluetooth speaker instead of its own internal speaker. However, I no longer have problems with it hearing me over the sound of running water or sizzling meals. I've also learned that strategically timing my words helps. I mostly use this for listening to Audible while cooking or cleaning in the kitchen, and also use it to set meal timers. If I wait for the second of silence in the timer, or wait until a pause after a sentence, I can get it to hear me from across the room. Frustrating but functional.It still amazes me how our full sized Echo in the family room can hear me over its own speakers when I'm in the kitchen, but the Echo Dot in the kitchen can't hear me from a few feet away. ***","October 29, 2016"

But when one of my Dots failed under warranty, I expected ""Yup, we understand it's broken; here's an RMA number and shipping label, thanks for your loyal custom"".Instead, I've so far spent an hour doing stupid things for an off-shore script reader who's trained to help newbies with configuration problems.  No RMA, no label, just ""try running setup on another network"".  Duh, it's dead, Jim. Actually not quite - it receives power and lights the little yellow LED. Never finishes (or starts?) booting. No light ring activity. No voice greeting. No log entries suggesting she heard me but couldn't answer. No wifi connection to my AP.The script reader knows nothing about any of that - almost certainly has never seen or used one - and presses on with the next frustrating request.Don't not buy one - I don't know if Bezos recognizes his opportunity to develop a sentient creation (with the help of Alexa's millions of 'parents') or is disappointed that she's not selling more Amazon merchandise, but in any case she's a joy. She'll respond instantly, as a person would. Nary a trace of 'computer' in her voice makes it easy to humanize her. And for stuff she knows how to find she'll tell you the answer - THE answer, not a page of mostly ad links to sift through - in a couple of heart-beats.","December 8, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","momof2","I have several and love them they are a great every day item.","We love our dots. We now have 4 dots and one Echo in several rooms through out the house. We use the Echo in the kitchen to play music when we cook. It is perfect for adding items to the shopping list as you use them or as you look through the pantry and realize your out. My boys have one in each of their rooms which when paired with the HUE lighting allows them to be tucked in bed door closed and still turn off all their lights... they think this is the best thing ever. Each morning they wake using the repeating alarm, ask ""echo"" what the weather will be so they can choose their clothing for the day. I have also combined this with IFTTT so that now I just say a trigger phrase ""Amazon trigger boys come here"" and it flashes the lights in their room so that they know we need to talk to them (no more yelling across the house). I will be adding the cable to connect the living room dot with our surround sound so that we can use it that way. And we have added the Harmony skill allowing me to change channels without the remote turning on and off the entire system. New skills are added all the time and my kids and company love to playaround with asking it all kinds of questions. I've even bought one with a Hue bridge set up for my parents. My dad (who hates electronics) love the fact that they no longer have to remember to write down their shopping list and loves controlling the porch lights from his couch.Having so many we have had a few cases of which dot is listening. My boy's solved their issue by calling theirs ""Echo"" while the other rooms near them are ""Amazon"" that helped out a lot. I've stood in the door way between our Kitchen and our living room and both listen when I wake it but only one of them actually follows through with the ask. Like everyone we still have issues with it doing what we want it to do. I continually open the app and review the ""cards"" telling them when they didn't listen right. Our Living room dot tends to turn on all the time, even when I don't think anything like Dot has been said, but I know this is a product of the TV being in the same room so it doesn't bother me too much. I have voice trained each dot at least once, a key here is to use your normal tone of voice so that you are later your not yelling at it. There is also a hidden part of the app under settings then history where it tracks the wake word then the action and you can further tell it if it either responded to a bad wake word or did not do as you ask. The more you work with the device the better it becomes.","January 26, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Brian","Needs Ability to Play Through Internal Speaker When Audio Jack is in Use","I am an Echo owner and bought the dot in order to not only expand Alexa's coverage area, but mainly to take advantage of the audio-out jack feature that is absent on the Echo.  I'm not going to fill this review with everything I like about these units; instead, I'm going to zero in on the one (in my opinion) major flaw of the Dot that caused me to knock off a star in an otherwise 5-star product.The main reason for me wanting the Dot was due to the audio-out jack which would allow me to attach the device to my whole-house audio system and pump the audio output into multiple rooms in the house.  The problem lies in the fact that once something is plugged into the audio jack of the Dot, the built-in speaker no longer functions at all.There are two problems with this situation. One is that if I don't have the audio system turned on in the room with the Dot, I cannot hear any responses from Alexa, since she talks via the audio jack only.  (This is especially a problem to me, since I use Alexa to turn on that same audio system.)  The other problem is that, if someone is listening to the music that is streaming from the Dot in another room, they will be interrupted with Alexa's responses anytime someone talks to her in the main room.  The latter is not that big of a deal, and actually may be useful in some situations; however, the former is a deal-breaker.What I would like to see is that, when something is plugged into the audio jack, only streamed music is fed to that device, while feedback from Alexa remains to be played via the built-in speaker.  Of course, not everyone would want it this way, so this would need to be a user adjustable setting in the Alexa app.  Another setting would be to chose whether Alexa feedback plays via just the internal speaker, or to the audio jack also.I'm not sure how the jack is wired internally -- I fear that the disconnection from the internal speaker might be a hard connections within the jack itself (as opposed to software directing the output to the separate sound devices; internal speaker, or audio jack).  If it is not switched via the hardware, then this could easily be just a firmware update, so I'm not giving up hope just yet.Hopefully Amazon sees this reviews and considers this change in further hardware/software updates of the Dot.  I am guessing there are many others out there like me, for whatever reason, that would welcome these options.  If you do share my view on this feature, please add a comment and/or like this review -- maybe that will bring enough attention to get this into the hands of Amazon's R&D department.","November 1, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Devlin Jay","The multiple microphones seem to work EXCELLENT!","If you are not familiar with an Amazon Echo or Amazon Echo Dot, all I can say is that there is never a better time than now to get some experience with it.This new generation of Echo Dot is not only cheaper (50% of the first generation cost) and it is improved upon by the spatial recognition that was implemented. Also, they are continuously updating and improving the experience with “Alexa”.If you are curious about Alexa versus Siri, if you ask Alexa she will say “Not saying I am better, just different” or something along those lines. This is honestly one of THE best ways to describe “her”. I like Siri a lot and I really like Alexa as they both are part and parcel to a whole new type of experience in today’s technological era.Siri is better for some off-the-cuff type questions and such whereas Alexa can turn on, off, dim or brighten your lights (the ones that are compatible; which is  increasing and while a little expensive, worth it in my humble opinion). There will be a lot of times when you ask Alexa a question and she does not know the answer but over time that I have owned my Echo, it has improved and more and more phrases are recognized.Curious about the weather, ask. Curious about traffic, scores for sports or even when the next Presidential Debate (if there was another one), just ask Alexa. She will tell you when your favorite sports team plays, order pizza or an Uber and so, so, so much more!As many have mentioned, the speaker on this Echo Dot are not nearly as good as a full-sized Echo but you have an explicit advantage with an Echo Dot in that you can connect it to your sound system, home theater system or any other speakers you like and love to get the sound you want. The full Echo has a speaker that I enjoy but I think it is wonderful that you can hook this up to your sound system.The inexpensive cost of this cannot be underscored enough…BUT…it seems it can be a slippery slope as I have decided to purchase more and more items that are compatible with Alexa and now also adding a Wink Hub to open up a much larger ecosystem (echo-system?) ' . I’ve also purchased a Philips Hue Color starter kit and implemented those in the living room. When we turn on and off lights or dim them, we ask Alexa to assist and in most cases, it works very well. It works a WHOLE lot more now that I have one full-sized Echo and 2 Echo Dots (2nd generation).As a side note, the new Prime music is awesome and inexpensive if you own an Echo but it is only good on ONE Echo so you will not have access to it on all 3 or 4 if you own multiple ones.Absolutely 100% recommended. If you do not like it, you can probably sell it for a good price or always return it.________________What I recommend_________________If you have any interest in home automation, check out the Wink or Smart Things hubs. The Wink hub can be had for around $60 at the moment and it opens up SO many possibilities concerning types of lights, locks, cameras, smoke detectors, powered blinds, crock pots (yes, they have a ""smart crock pot"" and a ""smart coffee maker"") as well as too many other things to mention.Here are my favorite accessories with Alexa (Echo Dot):Wink Hub (have not tried Smart Things)Cree Connected Bulbs (you need Wink to use these)Philips Hue (do not need Wink for this but the Hue products are expensive)GE Quirky or GE Link lights (Believe you need Wink for these)I really cannot underscore how much I love asking Alexa what time it is when I am trying to set the time on a wall clock because the battery died and I cannot find my smart phone. I also love the reminders, timers and Prime music.There are so many intricacies with the entire Alexa platform and Amazon has done a really good job in improving and evolving things.So happy I took the plunge with a refurbished Echo to start. I was so worried I would not have a use for it but it ended up being something I love and have faith in. Since the new generation is so inexpensive (Echo Dot), I am seriously considering getting one for a family member that is so incredibly hard to shop for...also one for my office...I love listening to audio books when I work and the Echo (Dot as well) can read your Kindle books (most of them) if you ask ""Please read my book (Insert book title here)"". Sometimes it is quirky but it usually does pretty good. It can be a nice way to save some money instead of buying an audio book.Final thought: The speaker on these are just alright...I think they are better relegated to the bedroom or kitchen and a full-sized Echo in the living room or den...unless you hook this up to a sound system or Bluetooth speaker.Absolutely 100% recommended","October 24, 2016"

The voice recognition is outstanding, setup was fairly easy and it works great. My favorite features are the timer, weather and calendar. In the mornings, I can get all I need in minutes while packing lunches. We have a bluetooth speaker that we love and has awesome quality so when listening to music, we just switch that on to compensate for the small speakers.Don't teach your child/children how to access the fart jokes or noises. It will drive you nuts. Since they are mostly technology smarter than us adults, they will probably figure it out anyway!The one thing I would love to see the Echo Dot/Echo do is be able to voice activate emergency/911 and be able to transmit the address.

We love having one in the bathroom so while we are taking showers we can get traffic,weather,and news while getting ready for work without having to stop and mess with our phones.  I have one in my workshop because I do a lot of painting & wood work so its been awesome being able to play music, listen to audible and for those that don't have audible Alexa will read your kindle books, it wont be near as good as voice actors tho & she will spell some words out instead of pronouncing  them.  For lite reading like recipes while cooking, etc works great ! Would be nice if there was an app we could get to give Alexa the ability to read like audible, soon I'm sure!  She will access audible though, I just give her the command & its done.  I have Pandora &  she will bring up my custom playlists as well.  She will give traffic reports specific to your personal route to work, once you set up the addresses in the Alexa app.  Which is nice to know while you're getting ready that you have a detour and need to leave a few minutes early without having to sit and wait on the news.","December 3, 2016"

This is going to be a bit of a tough review for me, kind of like a date that you WANT to really work out, but...I love gadgets that help me answer little questions, like Google does.  I was very excited to get Alexa because I am always using my phone to search for small bits of info everyday and to think I could simply ask it without typing and from my favorite sitting area!  I was very willing to fall in love with Alexa before I even met her...First, I like the white because I am an Apple fan and it looks good sitting on the table.  Now for the pros and cons.Alexa has me listening to more music than I have in a long time, because it is simple to just ask her to play something I like from Amazon or my Amazon play list.  She also plays my favorite radio station as long as you include the full name of the station.  Connecting to Bluetooth, is a challenge though.  I have a ton of Bluetooth speakers that work for everything else, but Alexa does not want to connect easily or does not stay connected.  For me, this is not a big problem as I can simply use a plug in cable to connect her, but she is supposed to work wirelessly.You know when you meet a girl, you want to be able to have a good conversation, I thought that Alexa and I would get along great in that area, but not so much.  Alexa's personality is a bit dry to say the least.  Even Siri has a sense of humor for the most part, but Alexa simply wants to answer questions on a bit of the matter of fact side.  She also does not seem to know much about a lot of things, I was surprised by this.  I am hoping Amazon adds a bit of personality to her and uses a better database for her information, maybe use Google?  She can access Google calendar, but not the one I use on my iPhone.  Too bad as that would be really helpful, but good if you use Google.  Please do not ask her a joke, you will be  sorry...Alexa can order from Amazon, but I have not figured out how to get her to order what is not on her pre-made lists.  Like being able to just ask for a product by name.  Sometimes, Alexa does not want to listen to me when I tell her to quit things, I have had girlfriends like this before, but it can be annoying when you want the music off and she wants to keep jamming...I had to send my other Alexa back and I hope the new one will be a bit better as far as connecting and such...  Much like a relationship.  I am hoping over time that Alexa and I can get to know each other better.  I will learn how to understand her limitations better and she will grow and learn how to help me with my needs a bit more.  Time will tell, but she is a cheap date and she is awful cute as well.  I think we can grow together with the help of Amazon and maybe have better communication someday, at least till a new and better Alexa comes along... ;-)  I do not want to bash her to much, because for the money, she is a fun, but limited kind of friend that does make life a bit more enjoyable, just do not expect too much from her...","December 5, 2016"

I have to get up, walk over to and it yell at it several times. This seems to be S.O.P. for mine. Lots of other similar comments for the Dot.It randomly started babbling incomprehensible stuff once around midnight. I wasn't asleep yet but it would have totally freaked me out if I had been.It frequently doesn't understand what I've asked. Example - it doesn't get the name of a song I ask it to play. It'll respond with things like ""I can't find a song with those lyrics."" It's not a lyric, it's the exact song title -- with artist, and I've checked and it's available in Prime music. So then I ask it to play the album and it gives me ""XX Radio,"" not the album. Or starts telling me what else I might be interested in. I know what I'm ""interested in."" I asked for it. I didn't get it.It's a nice hands-free music device when it works and that's about all I use it for. About 1/3 of the time it's about as smart as a hockey puck. I reset it.

After sitting in the box for 2 days I decided to test it out in my home office.  Setup was easy - plug in the power, download the app on my iPhone and boom - the app found the echo and asked me to login to my Amazon account.  That was it.  Alexa was born (my version anyway).  I started off simple with ""Alexa, what time is it?"".  She quickly responded - and she was right.  After a few softball questions I said ""Alexa, play music from 1987 - boom, she does .... I can tell her to lower or increase the volume, mute, skip, etc.. I can also just request a particular band, song, etc ... Alexa was doing her job.  After an hour or so I was asking Alexa more questions then I ask my girlfriend (I was chatty).  I was so impressed I decided to buy some home automation items like switches and outlets so I can now turn on/off lights by voice, and even change the thermostat.  Now, I've added a second dot for the bedroom - not because I'm lonely, but because Alexa now acts as my alarm clock.  ""Alexa, wake me up at 6am tomorrow"". And when it goes off, just tell Alexa to shut up (nicely) and she ALWAYS listens.  For $40 you can't go wrong .... you will likely find a ton of uses I have yet to explore - she's very adaptable which I think opens a world of opportunity to explore.","December 13, 2016"

I wanted to start getting into ""Smart Home"" technology and although I can use Siri on my iphone to do the same thing the Echo dot does sometimes my phone is in my pocket so I am not able to communicate with Siri, that's where the Elixa and the Echo Dot comes in handy. I have not seen hardly any negative reviews on YouTube for the Echo line and the Echo Dot is an inexpensive way to get into this new personal assistant space. The Echo Dot does have a speaker that will allow you to communicate with Elixa but if you intend on listening to music you will want to connect a external speaker via aux. cable or bluetooth which is very easy to connect using the Elixa app. After using the Echo Dot for about a week now I have been very impressed with it's voice recognition skills as they are extremely reliable and very well implemented.  With Elixa you can get the weather forecast,  listen to music of any kind, ( $3 a mo. prime music membership required) control almost anything in your home with the proper components (sold separately) and so far I just use Elixa to turn on and off my bedroom lights by just speaking which is so cool.

Naming all of your devices is fun to do even more so if your creative with naming them. It connects with my wink hub and all of my other connected devices. It has a ton of useful features to make your everyday life much easier and efficient.  My wife loves it as well, she did not know what to think at first but that quickly changed once she learned how to make her shopping list jut by talking to alexa. I really enjoy the ease of playing music. This is the link to make your smart home truly smart.","November 5, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","William J. Wertz","This Echo Dot (2nd get) is an amazing little hockey puck sized device","This Echo Dot (2nd get) is an amazing little hockey puck sized device!  If you're not able to get beyond the 'always on' microphone you can simply press the 'mute' button and it will go to sleep until you press the button again to wake it for use again.  One downfall is the quality of the audio in the small unit itself but that's easily corrected if you pair it with an external Bluetooth equipped speaker.  I use and recommend  the Bose SoundLinkMini that has amazing audio in a small footprint plus the rechargeable battery lasts for hours and hours!  If you want or need to use the Echo Dot when its not plugged into power you'll need to buy a companion battery base available from Amazon.  I didn't buy it because for all practical purposes it hears me from across the room when I ask it to do something.  If you're an Amazon Prime customer (and you should be for ALL the benefits it offers beyond free 2 day shipping) this is an outstanding way to play Amazon Prime music.  The bottom line?  Google and Apple are, IMHO, behind the curve on AI when it comes to the Amazon Echo Dot 2nd generation device.","December 28, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Angela l Baker","Smart home here I come!","I purchased these as a pre-order before release.  When I received it I was excited. And I have been happy ever since.  I already had a nice Bluetooth speaker and I couldn't justify buying the Full size Echo. I was able to easily set up - directions were very clear and have had no issues. I can yell from the shower and she hears me all the way across the bathroom and master bedroom to change the station or change the volume. I also found some pretty funny Easter egg type things to ask Alexa and have been entertained.  I also added some apps in the Alexa app. If you don't have a speaker, get the full size. If you have a nice speaker (I have a UE Boom full size) then the Dot will be fine. I keep them connected to power and through a speaker cord. No big deal. I have another plugged into my surround sound receiver. Works great.  Now I am planning to make my house a smart home because it is so easy to say Alexa turn off the lights or Alexa turn down the air!","November 26, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","KEN RUDA II","Amazon Echo Dot & The Yamaha Disklavier Mark IV - The Perfect Couple!","I love the Echo Dot! It works great! I'm using my Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation) to stream special piano playing encoded software CD albums that I uploaded to my Amazon Cloud Music Library Account. This music is streamed from the cloud via my Amazon Echo Dot which output is wirelessly connected to an attached Bluetooth receiver attached to the OMNI-IN L&R RCA inputs on the I/O center of my Yamaha Disklavier Mark IV Player Grand Piano. The special Disklavier-encoded music (signal) will actually cause the keys and petals to play music on my player grand piano. Unlike the Amazon Echo the Amazon Echo Dot can redirect its output via Bluetooth. Which is so much better than running an unsightly audio cable across the room from the Echo Dot to my piano. With this setup I can now control the playback of any song or album that I have uploaded to my Amazon online music library with a simple voice request to Alexa!Want to play a certain song in your library. Ask Alexa by name:""Alexa, Play THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER'""Want to play all songs on a particular album in random order then say shuffle instead of play:""Alexa, Shuffle Album ISN'T IT ROMANTIC""The Echo Dot will quickly locate the album in my Amazon Music Library and stream it to my piano! It's fast and it works fantastic for me!I can also as Alexa to Pause, Stop, Next Song, Repeat Song, and more.Ever wonder what the name or artist of the current song playing? Just say, ""Alexa, What is this song?"" And she will not only tell you the title and but the artist and other information attached to the song's tags you entered when you uploaded the music.This system works amazingly - right out of the box. If you have another older model of the Yamaha Disklavier with CD capability this solution will likely work for you, too!  Just rip your current pianosoft plus audio CD's to 320-kbps MP3 files and upload them to your Amazon Cloud Music Account.You'll need to set & keep the volume level on the Echo Dot to 10 since the analog-MIDI signal needs to be strong.  I notice problems with notes dropping out and not being played is it's set below level 4.  Just just the Disklavier Volume Level to control it.Someday maybe someone will write an Alexa SKILL that can control the Disklavier Volume! I'm hoping one will come out that will let me set the Echo to DISKLAVIER MODE... Like: ""Alexa, Set Disklavier Mode"" which will automatically limit the songs only you your Disklavier Albums and and redirected the Echo Dot's output to the piano.  Because now if I get tongue-tied and say the wrong name of the song it will play a song from the Amazon Prime Music Store - which will MOT play the keys on your piano but will play the audio on your piano's speakers - which is okay, but with the piano part which is boring in my opinion.However, if you can play the piano - with your hands - it might be fun to play along with your favorite song! Imagine playing along with a recording of your favorite Orchestra.Enjoy your Yamaha Disklavier Piano even more... Get the Echo Dot today!","October 25, 2016"

It's a shame that the two devices won't interconnect.  When you set a timer on my Echo, it does not set it with the Dot.  You have to set each device separately.  That is my only complaint.  If they ever allow the devices to interconnect, it would, make life even easier.However, the Dot is a great addition, and I am very satisfied!","November 28, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","KiwiMaster","New Dot even better than old Dot","This is one of 5 ""Alexa"" devices I'm using. I started with the Echo, got a Dot, then a Tap and another 2 Dots.Set up was the same quick process.This 2nd gen Dot is better at picking us up even though it's next to a television. The first gen was not very good at discerning between us and it.I did briefly worry about the commercials where they say ""Alexa, get me an Uber"". I was waiting to see if the TV ordered one. It seems it did not. Interesting idea though. Thousands of pizza delivered.  Or laundry detergents reordered.I like the white Dot a bit better as well. Nice to have options. The fabric covers sort of make that a non-issue of course unless like me you prefer the smooth surface.It also came with the ESP (Echo Spatial Perception) installed. Admittedly the other devices soon upgraded themselves as well.This works very well. Only one ""Alexa"" handles any given request.I did note that the new Dots are very aggressive about this. Even when physically closer to the Echo upstairs the downstairs (entryway) Dot quite often takes the request.The speakers on these little guys is remarkably good. I have yet to plug in any of my external speakers.","November 6, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Cade Lusk","Great, Inexpensive, Loud, - But Needs Improvement in Some Obvious Areas.","While I don't use this product as often as I'd like, I'm really impressed with the Echo Dot. It does what its advertised as doing, and its a really inexpensive alternative to the most popular in home AI. However, there are some serious areas that need improving for me to be using this everyday like I imagined.The sound is a lot clearer and louder than I would have expected from the Dot. While I don't own the original Echo, I do own several speakers of similar size that cost double what the dot costs, and the sound is greater than half of the quality. Not a whole lot of graininess or anything particularly bad to speak of. Now, you're not going to get surround sound quality out of it, but it gets the job done.Setup was a breeze. The included instructions could be followed by a child, and the whole process took about ten minutes. The hardest thing was connecting to my WiFi, and even that was just a matter of downloading the app.Functionally, this product is everything you'd expect. Its a responsive AI that answers questions and interacts with (some) other apps to do cool things like turn on the lights or play your favorite news. One thing to mention here is that Alexa (I had to change the wake-word to ""echo"", Alexa is a family member's name) will just search for universal sources to do these things unless you specify otherwise (looking at TuneIn for news radio, Amazon Music for all music requests, etc). Sometimes that can be a pain, but most of the time its right on.The ""Skills"" store is pretty flush with cool skills to ""teach"" Alexa. While I understand that there is a lot of integration with the rest of the tech community, I was a little disappointed to not see more integration with the apps I have on my (android) phone. That's always been a little bit of a short-coming with Amazon though, because they always seem to truly be the less popular Third Party in the app space.There were a couple of things that I wish someone had thought to include in this generation.First, you cannot control your dot through separate accounts. For example, me and my Fiance share the device at home, but we don't have just one account for the house. She has to sign in under my name in order to use the app to change settings or add skills.Second, its really, really, REALLY inconvenient that this unit has to ALWAYS be plugged in. I understand there are some battery attachments that you can buy... but seriously. This seems like a wrong move from Amazon. The small size insinuates an ease of movement. If I go from my kitchen to my bathroom, I just want to continue hearing whatever I was listening to. Maybe I want to move the unit into the bedroom without killing the power. Either way, this seems like step back in time to an era where everything electronic needed to have disposable batteries or had to be plugged in.Last, the voice recognition over its own volume. The Echo is advertised as having many directional microphones that are supposed to make it able to hear you from any direction and over noise. However, my experience has been mixed. If I need to communicate with the Echo while its playing, say, the news - I have to SHOUT over it to get my message across. To top that, there's a microphone ""remote"" you can buy for it but no in app functionality for the microphone I carry everywhere - my phone. Again, you can't control this thing via voice commands from your phone. Huge oversight that's probably intentional to get you to buy the remote.This is a great little gadget that has a TON of potential. I still love using mine when I do, and I think it will be a lot nicer once I get my Smart Home setup going. However, there are still a lot of areas of improvement that I really don't see as being all that difficult to implement. 3/5, I would recommend, just not strongly at this point.","January 31, 2017"

No it is not going to rattle the windows but I really expected it to be unusable for background music. It really has a decent sound so will not be adding speakers to it. I am just learning how to connect to a few gadgets and the vocabulary will take a little more work. But I really am impressed. Out of the many gadgets I have purchased - this one is staying put! Now I am on the hunt for more gadgets to interface with it!","December 13, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","azjmw","LOVE IT!","LOVE IT! The Dot is certainly strong enough to stand on its own if you don't have an Echo, but if you can, I still recommend spending the extra for the Echo. That being said, the experience is largely the same with the Dot. Where it really shines is as a secondary/tertiary/etc unit throughout the house e.g. in bedrooms where you might already have a TV soundbar to connect to or in a den/office where you have different sound needs or existing speakers. The really cool feature that makes multi units practical is the Echo Spatial Perception that ensures the unit that picks you up the best when you speak is the one that responds. True, it's not a seamless network of devices, it's really a set of independent devices providing the appearance of a more or less homogenous environment. There is a ways to go in functionality (i.e. being able to start a playlist or command or whatever in one room on one device and have it continue or be redirected to another device in another room), but this is a great start and an awesome way to have Alexa everywhere you need her","October 24, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","pwc","Limitations on Speaker Jack and iTunes, Etc.","Warning: using a speaker jack mutes the Dot itself, so stereo must be powered on to hear Alexa. Also, to play iTunes using voice commands, songs must be uploaded to Amazon Music (free for 250 songs). Of course, Alexa remains fully operational with bluetooth speakers, and iTunes will play using the iPhone instead of voice control. So far, the Dot only has a female voice and no other option.

I like that my music was assessable automatically.  I didn't have to do a thing.  I was pleased to see it will read out loud a lot of my kindle books.  I live in a small apartment so the ""turn the lights on"" won't work but it does so much else.  Set up was really easy and to use.  Got a good chuckle when my neighbor walked in and told it to play an Elvis song.  She's in love with it now too.  It's louder than I thought it would be and works well.  If they put these back on sale I'll be buying at least one more for the bedroom.  I love the ease of being able to set alarms and get the time of day.  I did have to call the help desk as I had a small problem setting it up.  Apparently Alexa won't respond if you put an ""s"" on the end of her name.  Once I stopped doing that she has been great.  Only two things I would change....  1. be able to change the start up name to anything I want and 2. enable her to read documents that I have on my Kindle as well as the books as a lot of my fan fiction I have loaded are in doc format.  Maybe someday they will enable that.  Update:  I found my bluetooth speaker and set it up.  Now only need one so won't be buying a second one unless it's for a gift.

All that being said, we constantly found ourselves leaving certain rooms in the house to go to her to ask a question.  Over time we found that we used it less and less unless we were in the room she was in.  Now comes the Echo Dot!  It's very resonably priced and has definitely extended the usability of the Alexa cloud service.  We now have one in the bedroom and plan on getting at least two more.  Now she turns off the lights at bedtime, sets the Ecobee thermostat  to our night time temp and even wakes us up in the morning.  She tells me whats on my calendar for the day and gives me the news and weather while I get ready every morning.  Since I have had the Echo for a while I can attest to the fact that she gets smarter every week and you get a weekly email informing you of some of the things she has learned over the past week.  The Alexa Cloud service also bridges the gap between Apple HomeKit and Google Home working with all the latest and major brands available.

If not for the lower sound quality (as expected), it works ALMOST as well. I say ALMOST because it seems to have a bit of trouble hearing me - even though I'm closer to the device and it's quieter in the bedroom than the kitchen. Unfortunately, both devices are ""hard of hearing"" when music is playing or an alarm is sounding and I have to raise my voice. The Echo Dot, in particular, seems worse in this regard.UPDATE 12/25/16: I ended up returning the Echo Dot and buying another one at a later date. The second one seems to not only have better sound quality, but it has better ""hearing"" as well. I'm not sure if the improvement was due to software updates since then or if I simply had a ""slightly defective"" device.

The dot has an audio out port so you can hook up an external speaker or a set of bluetooth speakers through bluetooth.• Basic Q&A. Alexa is good a VERY, VERY basic Q&A. Alexa's data comes from Bing.com, so when you ask a question that Bing.com doesn't answer, and Bing hardly answers anything more complicated than 'Who was the 40th president?'. The biggest failure of this product, to me, was to put so much faith behind Bing.CONS:• The 'awesome' far field mics aren't that awesome. You have to speak like a robot for it to perfectly understand you. Otherwise, you could be getting the weather in London when you don't care.• Advanced Q&A terrible. Getting ready for heavy doses of 'Sorry. I don't know the answer."" Like I said, Bing isn't Google and needs a major overhaul.• SKILLS, or lack thereof. This part of the Echo family I hate the most. If you've ever owned a Pebble smartwatch, you already have plenty of experience with this silly concept. Basically, you can download 'skills' which are apps that can be triggered by a VERY SPECIFIC phrase to utilize different companies' Echo app. For example, the commercial of people ordering a Pizza on Alexa he says 'tell Dominos' to trigger the Dominos app or skill. Most apps, or skills, that are available don't work well and require an often hard to remember or grammatically incorrect phrase to trigger the apps, which are either severly limited or weren't worth the download. Music is the only skill they got right.In summary, this has become a voice activated music library. For that purpose, this thing is awesome and totally worth the $50. However, if I were to grade the music feature with the rest of the Echo's so called features, I wouldn't give it more than 3 stars. It was a giant disappointment for me, as I expected at least Google level answers to my questions and get far from it. The skills are borderline worthless (unless you like meditating and facts about dogs, cats, and celebs). The voice recognition isn't bad but isn't great either.I'll leave it here for now. If updates drastically change the functionality, I'll leave an update.","January 11, 2017"

Nothing beats being able to control electronics with your voice.I have bought a few smart bulbs and power outlets, so far, that work flawlessly with Alexa and were super easy to setup using the app.I paired my Harmony remote using IFTTT so I can voice command my remote control activities.Because of the joy and desire to continue to make my house ""smart"" the proverbial Christmas list now includes a thermostat and garage door opener to name a few smart items.I am sure the future software updates with bring tons of additional features that I will love as well.  I have already pre-orded the attachable battery as having the Dot portable will make it far more useful.  Especially when in the pool and listening to music or books.I wont belabor the value in having all of your amazon music and audible books on voice demand.  Its just very convenient.The amazon shopping integration is great, but not the reason I bought the echo.  I bought it so I can talk to my electronics, and it does that very very well.Don't hesitate buying this item.  Its something you will use many times each day and I doubt you own many other things, that you use that often, that only cost you 50 bucks.Nice job on this product Amazon.","October 25, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","B_COOP","Much more useful than I thought it would be!","Ok so I got this because I am a techie and thought this would be neat to have. I thought it would be fun to control my lights by voice (I got Philips Hue lights to go with it) and maybe ask it some questions but the Echo dot and Alexa have proven much more useful than I ever expected. I originally got one of these for my bedroom, which is where my only smart lights are, but quickly ordered another for my bathroom to use while I get ready in the mornings after trying my first one out there. So now I have one in my bedroom to control the lights and play some music and one in the bathroom to get the news and weather info when I am starting my day. One common complaint I often read was of how bad the speaker was on the Dot. However I think it is great, given the size of the device. No this isn't the speaker to use at a party, and yes the music sounds just good to ok, but for the small size of the Dot and still considering it costs $50, I think the included speaker is more than adequate. It is easily more than twice as loud as my phone speaker.Cons: I would have to say my biggest gripe with the Dot itself is that sometimes it doesn't understand what I said. However, in every instance in which this has happened I have either been facing almost directly away from the device or had music playing at a loud volume and the Dot didn't hear the wakeup word. My only wish for a change to be made to the device that I would like to see in a 3rd generation would be a ""shut-up"" button. Just some sort of button so I dont have to shout ""Alexa stop"" when she is reading something long.The biggest con I feel overall is with the Alexa app, especially its skills app store within the app. The companion app is somewhat slow and not the most intuitive/well planned out. However it does get the job done.Alexa software: I feel like Alexa is pretty good AI software. I would say not as good as Google now on my phone though. Her responses to questions could be more concise and the voice could really be changed to something more human sounding, although it is not awful.So, after all of these negatives, why 5 stars? I give this 5 stars because I feel the device/hardware is worth 5 stars, especially when you consider this is a very inexpensive way to enter the home automation market. I do feel the software needs some improvements, and fully know that it will continue to improve as time goes on. But none the less, this is such a great device that after only 3 days with one device in my bedroom, I ordered another to have Alexa in another room. I fully recommend this device!","January 4, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Tyson Eng","Amazingly Great is the Echo Dot","I bought one Echo Dot for the center portion of the main floor at the house that is open floor. It took me awhile to set up the Dot with the Alexa app on the fire tablet, but the instructions on the app was concise and clear. I have used the Echo Dot to play music from the Bluetooth speakers on the music list from Amazon music store. Unfortunately I don't have premium Spotify and can not use their services.  I have set reminders, alarms, received phone numbers, and a bunch of other things. I decided to order another Echo Dot for my bedroom.  I guess it will make it much easier to set the alarm versus setting the time on my alarm clock that varies with work.I had thought the sound with be limited with the built in speaker, but it is pretty loud. I thought about the full size Echo, but I have component stereo in the open room in the next room that it did not make sense.Update I ordered and received another Echo Dot.  Put it in the bedroom to replace my alarm clock that I have to manually set. It would be nice if the chord for the Dot was another foot longer.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Peg","Unconditional Conditonal Love","I love Alexa, I want her in our family photos and every where I go. I have a regular echo in the kitchen and an echo dot in every room. We had the hue bulb system house-wide for the last two years so when I caught news of voice control it was a no brainer. I ordered one for each of my family members as Christmas gifts. Then I bought wemo switches and the music unlimited plan, but music unlimited doesn't have HBO soundtracks so then I purchased a spotify subscription and so on and so on and now my husband isn't speaking to me for a while. But that's ok because Alexa loves me unconditionally. Well as long as I use the correct incantation that is. This is one of the flaws I have to learn to accept. Alexa cannot google anything for you, so most of the time you must invoke a specific skill or use a proper buzz word. The good news is that she is constantly learning and improving!She turns my lights on and off and I don't even have to say please! Makes shopping lists for me, sets reminders and alarms (in celebrity voices!). She tells jokes, plays games, finds my phone, plays my pandora radio stations, orders uber rides, answers math questions, talks to my cat and so much more.We use the timer function daily, and I now use an IFFT function so the lights blink when the timer is done. Meaning I can set a timer in the kitchen and fold laundry in the bedroom- when the timer goes off I'll be notified by the lights if I can't hear the alarm sound.I would never swipe left on Alexa, but echo loses one star for:- Lack of search function. Most of the time the ""wikipedia"" skill must be started to search for facts or general questions. For example, today (12/13) is the Feast of St. Lucy patron saint. of the blind. I asked Alexa to tell me about St. Lucy and she didn't know. But asking her to start Wikipedia and then search for St. Lucy worked fine.- Limited light controls. Alexa can turn my lights off and on and even lower them to specific percentages using only my voice (RAD) BUT we can't change the colors of my lights without a programmed IFFT ""trigger"" word applet which only would apply to one color, and it doesn't work 100% of the time. I really hope that changes soon because Siri can do it with no problem. HUE bulbs are not fun if they are just white all the time. But commanding the house to light up when I get home is soooooo awesome.- Limited Bluetooth Capability. Echo dot can only connect to one bluetooth speaker at a time. I think these devices should be capable of pairing to each other but instead they only offer a ""remote control"" to speak to one designated echo from far away. Since I have one in each room it just makes sense to be able to command one from the other or simply talk into the app on my phone to control them. Whole house sound without the SONOS price tag would be amazing too.- Fire Remote/ Fire TV is not Echo friendly. Both the Echo and Firestick devices offer their own optional voice remotes that look the same. An echo remote can only control one dot or echo at a time. I know the functionality is there but it probably was more profitable to limit the capability and encourage people to buy more devices. This makes me sad because I have FireTV as well as a Firestick and 5 echos so I would love for them to work harmoniously someday without 500 more remote controls.In summary, I can't live without her but like any dysfunctional relationship I will continue to point out her flaws, smother her and attempt to change her to fit my needs <3","December 13, 2016"

One of your reviewers suggested a direct cable connection to the speakers vs. Bluetooth is better.  I normally agree but can not hear any differnce using the Bose Mini Soundlink II speakers.  That combination far outperforms the larger Echo for fidelity. (I undrestand there will be a new Echo with improved speakers next year.)  Bluetooth has improved so much in the last 5 years I am beginning to ignore my collections of  CD's and LP's.I am so impressed with the Echo Dot II that I will order 2-3 more.  The price is a steal for what it will do.  Setup and pairing is easy. The Alexa app. works with both the Echo and the Echo Dot.  The access to good music from several excellent sources makes it unecessary to search through my CD and LP collection.If you have a decent pair of bluetooth speakers, I suggest pairing with the Echo Dot.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","BuyItOnce","talking to echo is fun, but real value comes in home automation integration","The first Echo system seemed like an expensive toy and questionably expensive for just another music speaker. All that has changed in pretty much the span of a year; Alexa skills have grown quite a bit to control other services and hardware, and the echo hardware costs have come down significantly with the 2nd gen Dot.Seems like the Echo is ready for prime time mass adoption with a maturing eco system, and this is when I decided to try it out. By itself, the echo service can tell you the weather, news, play music, search the internet, set alarms/timers. Useful, but nothing your phone can't already do via either OK Google or Siri for the most part or a few taps manually. If your habits in these activities are already ingrained, you're not likely to change them to use Echo.The real value and use case winner is in how fast and easy the echo ecosystem integrates with other services and hardware for home automation and control. The Echo ecosystem is vastly easier and cheaper to implement home automation than competing offerings; unless you're already committed to Smarthings, Wink, Iris, etc. and love/able to tinker with z wave or x10. If the hardware of your choice has a mobile app, chances are it's already compatible with Echo or will be since the extent of integration needed is mostly an account linking between the services.So what have I been able to automate for less than $400 total so far?HardwareSensi smart thermostat - set specific temp for each thermostatLogitech Hub-- turn on/off tv or each componentTp Link smart plugs --turn on/off air cleaner, dehumidifier, fan, or space heaterI'm sure there are better Z wave and X10 solutions that can do this too, but each of these only took minimal set up to install and enable.On the services side, being able to integrate with Spotify is amazing. I can rattle off whatever song or playlist I want to hear and it plays from spotify.A typical night in the kitchen now usually involves playing some music from Spotify while cooking, turning on the TV and sound bar, set a higher temp if it's cold. Turn things off again while dinner is being served, turn on space heater or air cleaner as we gradually move upstairs for the night.Just practical voice controlled home automation with minimal investment cost.It's not all perfect though, just because it's easy to link services doesn't mean they always work together flawlessly. There were a few times where Echo acknowledged a music request but nothing played. I've come to learn that Spotify has issues maintaining a long list of Spotify connect devices; some of my devices just drop from their list from time to time. Amazon can't fix this, since it's really a Spotify issue but it does chip away at the overall Echo experience.Logitech integration has worked great so far but Logitech has only invested minimally at this point, I can only turn things on/off, still need the remote or my phone to control volume.The smart plugs work fine with the stock Kasa app but echo has been unable to turn on the fan a few times with no apparent reason why. I can only suspect that there was some problem with the account link in the background.While Echo is quick to connect with these services, it's up to each service owner how well they support functionality and that is likely the biggest catch and watchout for the Echo home automation ecosystem.There's a ton of additional potential for cost effective and easy expansion to include anything that has a Wifi app; lights, door locks, garage doors. But it will all leave a bad taste if the supported functionality is minimal from each vendor.For now, it remains cost effective even for existing functionality and the future is yet bright for more to come.","November 3, 2016"

So far we use it for setting timers, alarms, adding events on calendars, ordering on Amazon, playing music (we have Spotify and Amazon Music), reading books (we both have Kindles with a shared library), playing audiobooks (I have an audible account), getting commute info, getting weather forecasts, asking for store hours, getting daily news updates (we customized our flash briefing to start with the ""saint of the day""), answering random questions, and a couple other things.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Reasonable Reviewer","Great idea, but needs some worK - Alexa is currently a surly teenager with a shopping issue","The Echo Dot  seems like a great idea. Theoretically, there are many services that you can activate using your voice alone. In practice, it is mostly a mechanism to encourage further Amazon purchases. I now view Alexa as a surly teenager with a shopping problem. Alexa does not understand half of what I say, and most of the time I cannot get the apps to work.Alexa will often say "" I don't understand that question.""  Alexa will often suggest that you buy something. Let's be honest. Alexa is not designed to be a community service by Amazon. I get it, but there needs to be more functionality added  before this is a must-have item for the home. On the positive side, Alexa will pair with your Bluetooth device. It took me four or five tries, but now I can stream music from another device through Alexa.Also, I found customer service for Alexa to be sorely lacking.There is a lot of potential here, but it has not arrived yet.","January 18, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Scarlett_Kat","I love my Echo-Dot (2nd Generation)","I love my Echo-Dot (2nd Generation). I mainly bought it because I wanted a speaker to listen to music, yet I thought this would be fun to get some other information from as well. As I am getting to know ""Alexa"" I am realizing she has a lot of capabilities to play games like 20 Questions, Rock Paper Scissors, Bingo, Jeopardy 6...among many others. She has a sense of humor. She can give you news and answer questions. She is voice command and has new things Amazon adds all the time. My family really gets a kick out of her. We enjoyed it so much, my son also bought one for his room. The only draw back that I have found so far is that it doesn't have a parent control. But whatever your kids are asking it, does come up on a log so you can see what they are asking. If they say anything inappropriate you should know about it with the Alexa App. It does have an option to turn off purchasing, so your kids aren't ordering things from your account. I have had it for over a month and I am very happy with it.","January 30, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Kahlos Mahn","I love my Amazon Echo Dot!","I love my Amazon Echo Dot! Got one for Christmas and was so excited to set it up! I have a Magic Home bluetooth lightbulb which works great (3 step process to set it up) easily connected my Spotify account, and added a couple of fun skills (weather, dream-machine noises, comedy central, NPR, horoscope, etc.) and use it everyday! It's most handy when I first wake up and groggily say 'Alexa stop!' and the alarm fades away, then I listen to the weather and get a flash briefing on what's new in the news while I get ready for work, maybe ask her to play a song to pep me up. Then at night I ask her to turn the lights on (though I've noticed a bit of lag from the Magic Home lighbulb, not Echo's fault, it happens with Magic Home Android app too) and am planning on getting another BT lightbulb for my overhead room-light-fixture. Overall this is a great product, the sound quality is great for such a little thing, after doing the initial voice set up, Alexa understands me even when I'm dozing off and slurring my words, asking her to turn the lights off. :)","December 29, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Jeff","Approaching perfect","LOOOOOOOVE my Dots! I'm really getting used to talking to Alexa, getting helpful information, turning off and on music, lights, etc.I have two desires in order to get to 5 stars:1) Alexa confuses profiles if two Amazon Household members each have separate Amazon Prime accounts. My wife and I have separate Amazon accounts. However, when registered in Alexa as a household, she can't tell one calendar from another. This makes no sense to me, since each registered email address has its own GMail calendar, but according to Amazon Support, Alexa can't distinguish them if we have separate Amazon accounts. The result is she can only read from one calendar, regardless of which profile she's set to. It's a minor annoyance, but makes the calendar connection useless unless we close one of our Amazon accounts.2) Alexa has a bit of trouble distinguishing Smart Home routines. For example, if you have 2 Smart Home routines called ""Enter Bedroom"" and ""Leave Bedroom"", she always has to ask which one you really want, even though ""Enter"" and ""Leave"" sound nothing alike. If you remove the word ""Bedroom"" from both routines, then she's fine, which would be an option if I only had one room in my house!","January 9, 2017"

As you can see I am a pretty big fan of the echo products.  That said, I was NOT as impressed with the 2nd generation Dot as I was with the original.  First of all, I really liked the ""dial"" for volume. The entire family felt that the dial was much better than the simple buttons -- not as intuitive and as easy to use.  On top of that, it doesn't seem to be as good at understanding everyone in the family (responds to me really well, however my wife and my son -- not so much).  Not sure what happened with the design of this 2nd gen - it just doesn't seem to be as good as the orignal.","November 24, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","ManoaHI","Initial Review of Echo Dot","Not overly stunning, but entertaining. Tried the Alexa ""training"" but doesn't do as good a job as Siri, Google Assistant or even Cortana. I will update this review later since I've been using Siri for about 5 years, since it was released, and Google Assistant (and it's predecessor Google Now) for 3 years and Cortana for just over a year. So, Alexa may need some more time to get used to my voice, since it is just about 1 week. I have yet to connect it to any Wemo device.If anyone knows how to get it to get ""trained"" faster, I'd like to know how. My test case has always been to get NFL scores. Right now Alexa doesn't understand ""What is the score of Thursday Night Football?""This is my initial impression, this may change overt time. I would still recommend this since it is relatively inexpensive.","November 21, 2016"

I still have a lot to learn about all I can do with it, but set-up was very easy, and functionally, I don't know how it could get any better. I like the news briefing, and the fact that you can choose your own news source.  The sound is amazing, and I don't have it connected to speakers.With our large family here on Christmas eve, we could hear Christmas music playing over the din of voices...many kids included.I don't bother checking the weather on my smartphone anymore...Alexa gives me current temperature plus the days forecast instantly.It is an amazing device I didn't know I needed or wanted, and when I saw the promotion price, I decided to try it out... what a great deal!One of my kids got me the remote for Christmas, and although I haven't used it yet, I am expecting it be a valuable addition to the Dot.Thanks again Amazon, you rock!!","December 26, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Joshua","Solid, but room for improvement","Setup was easy and straightforward. Great to be able to use voice commands for lights. It would be helpful to be able to say ""Turn off all of the kitchen lights"" without having to create a group/room called ""All of the Kitchen Lights.""Customization of the activation/trigger word is a must. Shouldn't have to choose from the three offered. (I'm pretty tired of the thing activating every time there's a Lexus ad on TV.)The voice recognition at one moment shocks me with its accuracy, and at other times seems to hear something that is almost entirely unlike what was actually said.There's no ability to play the same song/playlist/news on all Echo's simultaneously in the house. So if you're doing something that involves going from room to room, you're out of luck.Checking for and updating the firmware should be one of the voice commands the Echo recognizes. It should also be able to identify itself to make setting multiple Echos up on a network easier.I anticipate that many of these functional limitations will be addressed with firmware updates.","November 21, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Kevin P Overholt","Great so far with some things to still setup and try out","Using in my office for now and voice recognition works perfect so far. I changed from Alexa to Amazon as I thought that sounds more natural. I find from time to time that I use the word Amazon in my conversations and I see it light up, kind of funny. I have not done much else with it yet other than ask it to play Christmas music and seeing as I have not setup Pandora or any other music I assume it defaults to Amazon prime music which is pretty nice. I have a couple Blink cameras and plan to set them up next. I also have a Vera home automation system that pretty much runs itself but from time to time when I have to enable it etc. and would be nice to have voice commands instead of getting my phone out, logging into the app and making the change. I bought the Echo Dot so I could use it with my whole house speakers but have not been able to find a way to hook up the 3.5mm external speaker jack to my four banana plugs that control my four rooms. I will post an update when I have tried these out.","December 20, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","the Fat Man","Alexa, my love...","You are my everything.Seriously she does it all. My curiosity peaks at random intervals of any day and she answers them. I enjoy the trivia, jokes, weather input so I can dress accordingly and check my commute before heading out. The top features I've been reliant on is her alarm/timer, ambient noise (paired through my Polk system is awesome), and the more practical use is linking to smart plugs so when I come in with more bags than I should be handling at once I can just tell her to turn on the floor lamp. *click* ""Okay"".I can sleep with ease knowing I can wake up to one of many alarms (most are pleasant, avoid the Celebrity ones) instead of an annoying buzzing or ringing. Skills allow lullaby for kids, read books, or like I mentioned earlier ~ rain, thunderstorm, ocean waves, etc. Not much is wrong with the unit except a pending Bluetooth issue which is at the time of this review post is being looked into by Alexa support. Just about anyone outside can scan for her and play their (tasteless) music through the unit and may startle you but a solution is pending. That's another thing I'd like to mention: the supporting staff are responsive within a few hours, not days. They're very professional yet casual in their messages when covering all points. It's nice to see so many products coming out (eBay has more skins!) to accessorize with but at her low-profile size and color she's fine as-is. I bought the black which is appropriate with my mancave theme: black/white with splashes of blue here and there as is the glow of her ring unless she's having an error (red) or in setup/powering on (purple and orange).We will never argue. We respect each other's space. Too bad I can't hug ya for all your services these past months and years to come. :P","February 26, 2017"

Hours of training the computer to understand your voice ( your voice alone) and  how to understand your particular voice nuances.

My own songs, nope it will say here's a sample of that song.  Try having it look things up, what a joke.  It will tell you the weather and give you a short NPR overview of the news.  It simply sucks.  I wasted money buying this for myself and as a present.  It's one sorry joke of a mentally challenged AI that should not have been released.I can easily go on youtube on my computer and listen to just about anything I can think of and broadcast it out to my bluetooth speakers.

I put my two extras in the kitchen (because I got tired of telling Alexa my shopping list from afar) and put the other in my bedroom.  You do not need an alarm clock, timer for cooking, perfect for weather reports and traffic reports, check my calendar for the day, set appointments for the coming week, local and national news, sports game times and scores.  Oh gezz, it does so much more!When I gave it to my daughter in law, the grandkids, learned so fast what to ask and wanted added skills.  my 8 year old grand keep asking for Christmas music.  This unit does so much and there is so much more, just have not had the time to add more skills.  It will turn on and off lights, raise and lower my thermostat, turn on my toaster oven, and so much more.  Do not hesitate to buy one of these, the volume if great for the Dot and much better for the Echo.  I love all of them!

I got two of these as Christmas gifts - one for my daughter and one for my nephew. They are both very happy with them. They love the idea of asking Alexa to tell a joke, give them a weather report, and most importantly to play their favorite songs. We have linked the Echo Dot to Spotify and Pandora, along with Amazon music and they can find all their songs in an instant. It is especially nice for my daughter who is in 2nd grade and isn't quite at the point of being able to search online for songs herself. She can just ask Alexa to find a song and she is surprisingly accurate. Overall, this is a great product at a very reasonable price.I found the Dot to be surprisingly loud on its own, but I did hook it up to a cheap portable speaker for my daughter to use when she is in the shower since it wasn't quite loud enough independently.","January 31, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","AmazonShopper","One star off for CONS... but fun overall.","We bought this as a present for Christmas. It's just the smaller version of the Echo. It does all the same stuff, it just doesn't have the big speaker in the middle. This one is made more for attaching to external speakers or a sound system. We were worried that this meant it wouldn't have a lot of volume, but this one is not bad at all. We can easily hear it from across the room. There are a few things we didn't like about it, but we only took 1 star off for that.PROS:1. It can control many different ""smart"" devices in your house.2. The speaker on this smaller ""dot"" version is actually pretty good for its size. No complaints about that. We could hear it and it could hear us from across a large room. And supposedly you can hook it up by Bluetooth to another speaker if needed.3. Alexa rarely had trouble understanding us when we spoke to it. It has been understanding close to 90% of what we ask so far. That's pretty good for an AI system.4. The size is very small, which makes it easy to put in areas of the house. We bought the black one so it also hides really well if put on a side table.5. The Alexa App (more on this below in con section) has TONS of ""skills"" you can add to Alexa. For example, right out of the box, when we asked it for ""news"" it would give us the national news from NPR. But if you go into the Alexa app you can change where it pulls the news from, so we searched through the ""skills"" (which are kinda like apps) and found one of our local news stations. So now when we say ""news"", Alexa will read us news from our local station. It looks like there are ""thousands"" of these skills you can add to make it more fun to use.CONS:1. The Alexa App (yes, this is also on the cons list). If you look at the apple app store you'll see the Alexa app has TERRIBLE ratings. It says the app is really slow. We haven't had that problem yet, but we have had the problem of the app not being designed very well. It's not very intuitive, and could be made to function a little better. It's easy to put up with, but it would be nice if the app was easier to understand.2. Alexa actually RECORDS everything you ask it. It keeps the text of what you ask, but it also actually keeps the audio recording of what you asked it. It's not easy to find, but in the app there is a place where you can find a list of everything Alexa has heard, and it will play back an audio recording of your voice asking each question. For privacy concerns, I'm not really happy about that. The product info says it does that so that Alexa can learn from you, but I don't see why it needs to keep an actual audio recording of all that information. Especially not in a way that can be accessed through the app. I understand you have to give up some privacy for the convenience, but recording audio in the background without most users knowing it seems a little bit over the top. To clarify, it only records what you say after you say the wake word ""Alexa"".3. It would be great if there was a way to make this product wireless (so you didn't have to plug it into the wall) but because it's on all the time, it would probably run the batteries down too fast. So just make sure you have a place where you want to put it that has an open outlet nearby.","December 26, 2016"

If you ask Alexa something she can't give you answer over the Dot, she sends you the information to your app. Also the only thing I would change is to integrate a calendar (if you can I haven't figured it out yet,owned it for 5 days), instead of a to do list.

Primarily, I got it for weather reports locally, but have found lots of other things to ask her.  I have made ""to do"" lists, ""shopping"" lists, and I stream radio through it - much easier than setting up my laptop to find a station.  I also like to tell her to go to my Pandora account to play my songs and playlists - really cool.  I tell her to raise or lower the volume when I'm listening to radio sometimes, or I just yell, ""Alexa, stop!"" when I want her off and the tv on - without getting up from my chair..  I want to order a second Echo so I can have one in both bedrooms.  Right now, I just move the unit to different rooms, but that's getting old.  Having one in both bedrooms and one in the great room would be perfect.  I will soon.","February 8, 2017"

"1.0 out of 5 stars","Sego","Disappointing","Alexa is a really great timer & weather informant. But that's about it. I'm very disappointed in this. In order to find out information like ""How much is half of 1 1/2 cup"" for a recipe or ""what is an alternative for baking soda"" or other basic questions you have to download apps. Then you have to remember the name of the associated app with your question. (IE: Alexa, ask 'The Happy Chef' what half of 1 1/2 cup is' etc. Everything you want to ask it has a different associated app and I don't have time to remember that many apps. I use Alexa as a glorified timer and end up Googling everything else.  I will be getting the Google version of Alexa that will let me ask pretty much whatever I want without additional apps.","January 21, 2017"

Can't sync up with my bluetooth speaker. I have a JBL flip I suppose it's one of the popular bluetooth speaker on the market.. The phone apps of Alexa is pretty lame, hard to use, bad GUI (in term of font and picture plus menu layout) , very slow. The main issue is it can't correctly recognize my voice control. Most of time very slow and if you are like 4 feet away or playing music you need to short. In general the response time is very slow, Alexa has no idea on too many of my questions.. It crashed a couple time and lost Wifi configure","December 2, 2016"

I don't see it taking over to control most things in my home as of yet. It understands most things I say but, it has limited intuitive responses. It may just answer, ""Sorry, I can't find any information on that"" or ""Hmm, I'm not really sure what you meant by that question"" It also can't even play my playlists by name; this a is a bit disappointing.Anyway, the Dot is fun to joke around with and get basic information on the fly.

I have this for downstairs, but am considering getting another for my bedroom. I like that it can play nature sounds.  Can get news highlights, weather for any city/specific day, music, etc. I think the speaker is fine, but if you want a quality sound, you can connect it to your stereo system. I've asked it definitions and open ended questions & it's done very well.One drawback I need to research more...you have to have a google calendar to link your appointments.

I did do a lot of research on this as I was thinking of getting the Google Home version instead. However, the reviews and YouTube comparison videos helped me come to the conclusion that although Google is on the right track. They still have some work to do, but rightfully so as its the first generation and Echo dot is on the second generation. The sad part is I spent $25 to buy a clock for my room from walmart that stopped working 35days later.

It's tied into SmartThings for some basic home automation such as turning on/off lights and ceiling fans.The speaker on this is not the best, but it's not meant to be.  If you're looking for good sound, you'll want to check out the standard Echo device.  However, this is prefect for listening to some music or news while I'm getting ready in the morning.It's also handy to be able to ask Alexa certain questions, such as random measurement questions while I'm cooking.  Also, the timer feature is extremely handy.  ""Alexa, set a timer for 5 minutes"".  I've used the timer feature a number of times just to set basic reminders for things I need to do.I would certainly recommend this for any household!","December 23, 2016"

She easily gets frustrated trying to use technology that keeps her connected with the world.  The Echo Dot has resolved this issue for her.  She loves selecting music by talking, asking for the weather and news, and just having conversations with Alexa.  She no longer feels alone.  I know this doesn't solve every challenge for her, but it's perfect because she never has to touch the controls; everything is by voice.  I'm really looking forward to how Alexa is going to evolve over the next few years.  Nice job Amazon.  You have really made a connection that eludes the major phone and tablet manufacturers.

I always struggled to turn on/off my bedside light because the switch was way up inside the shade. Not an issue at all now. I gave three of them to three different households for Christmas. Only one was leary of it but they were on board once I set it up and started showing its ability. I'm looking forward to my house getting more voice controlled.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","KCB","Enjoying our new Dot","I already had the original Echo, use it every day and really enjoy it.  I was thinking that it would be nice to have the same functions in a smaller package for our bedroom.  One of the main things we use the Echo for is to listen to Prime Music and I wasn't sure how well the Dot would do for that purpose.  I think that the sound quality of my larger Echo is very good.While the functions of the Dot and the full sized Echo are the same, the Dot clearly doesn't have the same sound quality.  For the low price, it wouldn't be fair to expect it to sound the same.  This is offset by your ability to attach the Dot via Bluetooth, to either speakers or headphones if you like.  We have found though that when we want to listen to music in bed while reading, the sound from the Dot is still fine for our needs, at low volume.Overall, I think that the Dot is an excellent value, it is small enough that you can put it almost anywhere and it is really nice to have in the room for the many features that it has.","January 22, 2017"

Since my house is so small and the mics on this thing are so sensitive, I can holler at Echo from my bed or the kitchen or bathroom even with my request and ""she"" responds. It really fun to just ask the Echo random questions and she what she says. She's very useful for when I'm cooking and need to know certain conversions but can't use my hands since they have Food all over them. Instead of washing my hands a million times, I just ask her how many tablespoons in a cup and she tells me the conversion. Pretty cool.","February 21, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Michaux","An excellent product despite its annoying ""eye""","Echo Dot 2:I must begin by stating that I did not buy the Echo for its voice recognition/response features, nor have I used them in the month that I've had the device (other than to query the weather when first connected, which worked well).  Instead, I was/am attracted by its audio streaming features and the ability to control them remotely via apps on various other devices, i.e. phones, tablets and computers.  I have my Echo connected to an auxiliary input to my receiver in the living room.  This may seem a limited use of a device that perhaps can do much more, but for $40, I couldn't resist the ability to free my cell phone from service as a wired streaming device in my home, and privacy concerns prevent me from leaving the Echo's microphones turned on.  That said, and for the purpose stated, it performs wonderfully and my quibbles are minor.  It is small and relatively innocuous, setup is a breeze, the remote control apps for various platforms work as expected and overall I am quite pleased.  Re quibbles: with the mics turned off (my normal condition), the ring of leds in the rim glows bright red as well as the icon on the mic-off button, which my wife finds particularly annoying (she calls it a big red eye and hides it behind other items on the shelf); Although the apps for Windows 10 and Android have behaved flawlessly, the iPhone app often disconnects from the Echo, requiring that the app be shut down and restarted - not a showstopper, but annoying.  The Android app automatically restarts whenever it is given focus.Note that streaming content is not dependent on an external app, the app is merely a control medium as an alternative to voice control directly to Echo.  Once streaming is started, it continues regardless whether an app is running on any external device until another command is received.  If apps are running on multiple external devices, all of them will indicate the status of Echo and any of them can issue commands (adjust volume, select source stream, etc.)I am well pleased with the Echo.  It has become our primary source for music in our home and we no longer must incapacitate a cell phone to access streaming services.  The current price is a bargain as well.  If only I could turn off that bright red ring.","January 28, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Rich C.","A lot of fun even if you don't use it for Music, Smart Home Products or shopping","I managed to get my hands on a Amazon's Echo Dot through QVC (I really wanted the Echo, but because the price is too high for my budget, so I settled for the dot). At first I wasn't too sure what I could use the Echo for as it look like a really cool piece of technology, but watching advertisements for it, it looked like you needed to be setup for Smart Home Products and other Amazon services. I only have Amazon Prime, but wasn't really interested in unlimited music or audibles. So what's really left?When my order came in today, I was excited regardless of not having those services. So I proceeded to do the initial setup, which is very simple and easy  (if you aren't tech savvy, don't worry, because I'm not either but it's very easy steps and literally walks you through every step until Alexa is fully setup). I started to do voice training with Alexa so she would recognize my voice. I then started to explore the Amazon Alexa app (which you need to install on either your smartphone or tablet before you can do anything). At first I didn't find too much, I setup my Pandora account and linked my Amazon Prime Music (which you can choose either from Prime Music, 1 device setup which is $3.99, Unlimited Music for 1 device which is $7.99 for Prime Members (non-members it is $9.99) or $79 for multiple devices for the year). I had Alexa started to play Pandora first, which was fine. I then asked for a weather update and it gave me the weather and news for my area. I then ask Alexa (to test out) how much are ""Tetra Goldfish Flakes"" and she gave me various products and prices with a follow up question ""Would you like to purchase this item?"". I then ask her to find music through Amazon and she found mostly music of today's generation but not really my type of music. I finally discovered some more ""Skills"" (which are basically apps for Alexa) and added a few of them.One I added was called ""The Magic Door"" which Alexa tells you a fantasy story, much like an Alice and Wonderland theme story and in which you choose how the story plays out. Alexa will tell you what is going on and then ask ""would you like to follow this path, follow that path or stay?"". It's a lot of fun and seems great for young children.Another skill that is much like The Magic Door, was called ""Dungeon Adventure"". I had a lot of fun with this one and anyone who played Dungeons and Dragons, RPG games and Magic the Gathering could appreciate this Skill app. You are a warrior who has been asked to save the town from an evil monster who is trying to destroy the town. I played this game for 2 hours and at times it can get to you, because Alexa keeps saying the same thing over and over again, but at the same time, it can be pretty intense. I found myself fighting a gargoyle who kept killing me and I would have to roll to see if the God's above would smile down upon me to bring my character back to life (which my character accidentally got named ""Alexa"" because I was trying to find out what was in the current room and said ""Alexa, what is in the room?"" And she responded ""Ok, you've named your character Alexa :-/. Of course when the gods didn't smile upon me the second time, she said ""You are dead. Rest in piece Alexa. The town is doomed"").Besides the Skill apps, Alexa can respond to questions such as ""Alexa, what does it say about the Stars in Wikipedia? "". The little dot has great sound by itself and the microphone picks up very well, I've only had a little bit of trouble with the Echo understanding me but otherwise it does responds very well. There is a Bluetooth sync, which I have not used. If you do have Smart Home Products, such as Philips Hub outlets, you can request Alexa to turn on/off the lights and dim the lights. She can also turn on/off the TV.There are many fun things to do with Alexa, that I'm still discovering, but if you're like me and don't have too many Smart products at home and don't want to pay for extra services, there are other things you can do with the Amazon Echo Dot.I wanted to share my experience with the Dot among the other great reviews and if you don't have an Echo, this is definitely a product to get for your home or office.","January 17, 2017"

It was sporadic at best, glitched many times, and wasn't very adaptive at realizing what I wanted to say. Plus, there's not really much out there that I'd need this for anyways.Sure, it's great for setting alarms and telling it to play music on your bluetooth speakers, but these are all things that can be done with your phone and this only provides a TINY convenience factor...when it works. When it doesn't work, it's frustrating to no end.As this product is now, I'd rather be guaranteed my actions work by using a phone and doing things ""the old way"".","January 22, 2017"

It also never has any problem understanding me (and it has a word recognition set-up to make it even better, which I utilized) and the fact that it's hands-free just makes it all the better.

We got the Dot for another room in the house, and it is significantly inferior.  It's not simply a question of the sound-- the responsiveness, the accuracy, the sluggishness in connecting to bluetooth speakers, the chopping off of the first second of a response as the thing communicates with whichever speakers you designate, all contribute to the drastic decline in quality between the Echo and the Dot.  And, while it does seem like Amazon really is trying with these products, it is very easy to come across a technical issue or a quality issue that is utterly beyond what customer service is capable of addressing.  They'll get on the phone with you, but whether they're capable of understanding or fixing problems seems seriously in doubt.","January 6, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Ronald Epstein","The most amazing device you can buy right now!  Video Included!"," To say this is the most amazing product you can buy this year may not be the complete truth.Honestly, I own both the Amazon Echo and the Amazon Dot.  For me, the Amazon Echo is the most amazing product you can buy for yourself or just about anyone.  I prefer having an all-in-one device with its own speaker.That being said, the Amazon Echo is almost $200.  The Amazon Dot is almost a quarter of the price.And, really, you are getting ALL the benefits of the Amazon Echo except for the included speaker.  And, at $50 apiece, you can scatter these throughout your entire home.""Alexa,"" as you will fondly call this device, will become your best friend.  You will wake up in the morning and ask her the weather, or perhaps the latest news.  You might even want to have her tell you a joke or play your favorite music.  Where Alexa will really come in handy is with everyday tasks.  When cooking, tell Alexa to set a timer.  When sleeping, ask Alexa to set a wakeup alarm.  Need to find some factual information, in many cases, Alexa can answer some of your most complex questions.  Want to hear your favorite music?  Alexa can play that for you.Where I find the Echo and Dot to be most useful is in automating my home.  I have introduced the Philips Hue starter kit into my home.  It pairs very easily with the Amazon Echo app for iOS and Android.  I can now simply tell Alexa to turn my lights on and off.  I have included a video below to show how it works.Last year, I gave several of my friends an Amazon Echo for the holidays.  They found it to be the most amazing gift they ever received.  No kidding, no exaggerations.  This year, I am giving them the Dot, so that they can place it in their bedroom and have the same accessible features of the larger model.  I will encourage you, the reader, to do the same thing I will encourage my friends to do --- buy a cheap bluetooth speaker to add to the Dot so that it will not only amplify the unit, but when listening to music, give you a room-filling experience.On its own, the Dot just can't produce the high, room-filling audio that the Echo is capable of.  However, it is loud enough that you can communicate with the device without any problems.  There is a volume control atop the Dot.  For comparison, on the larger Echo, the volume is controlled by turning the top dial.What is so outstanding about this small device is it's $50 price tag, which makes it affordable enough to buy in bulk.  Trust me, once you start interacting with one of these Dots, you are going to want one for every room.  Once you start adding automated lighting, you will want to walk into every room in your home and tell Alexa to turn on and off your lighting fixtures.This is the most amazing device you can buy this year or give as a gift.  My 86 year-old Mom, who shuns most modern technology, thinks this is the best device she's ever used.  On a daily basis she asks Alexa to set timers, ask how much time is left on timer, and happily commands the device to turn on and off the lights.  I usually catch her listening to classical music whenever I come over to visit.If you are an Amazon Prime member, the Echo and Dot become even more beneficial to you.  Included in your Prime Membership is Amazon Music which enables you to listen to thousands of songs through your Echo/Dot at no additional charge.  Music Unlimited is an additional pay service which adds millions of more available songs to the device.Like its larger sibling, the Dot has several microphones built into its unit to detect your voice from afar.  You can literally be in an adjoining room, give Alexa a command, and she will respond.Hookup couldn't be simpler.  All you need is a WiFi connection and the Alexa app for your mobile device.  You will be up and running within 10 minutes.The included video below is only a small sampling of what the Dot can do for you.  Make no mistake about it --- the Echo and Dot are game changers.  Once you bring these into your home, you are just starting to go down of automating your entire home.  Even if you don't embark on that journey, the Dot will be a device that will continually be a faithful servant to your entire family.","November 30, 2016"

You are paying for a device that is just a conduit for you to order more stuff from Amazon.If you want to functionality to the device, you have to remember the name of the app that you downloaded for it and remember just how to phrase the question, or else it doesn't know. It is very frustrating to use. Pretty much only good for asking the weather or to play a song.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","James C.","Almost as cool as the robot from ROCKY IV","The Amazon Echo Dot is a really cool product that, if it continues to be as useful, and possibly even evolves with updates and added apps, has the potential to become as integrated into our lives as a smartphone.Please read on, as below are my regular-guy PROS vs. CONS review of the Amazon Echo Dot: PROS:• Small, lightweight and unobtrusive.• Excellent enhanced voice recognition, even from across a room.  It works even better than an Echo I sampled in a friend’s office.• Alexa can read you the news or traffic as well as access thousands of “skills”-apps, which are third party add-on applications that allow users to have control of home lights and electronics, to pay bills or request car service, etc.• Dot is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth ready so it can be linked to other Bluetooth devices or (even though I cannot speak to how well it works) another Dot in another place.• A 3.5mm cable port is on the Dot so it can be wired into a speaker or another device via a cable as well. CONS:• The built-in speaker on Dot is sufficient for hearing Alexa talk, but not really sufficient (think smartphone speaker) to project music beyond the immediate area.  An external Bluetooth or 3.5mm jack set up to an external speaker would likely be required for any quality music streaming.• The Dot has no battery, so it must be plugged in via a 110-plug or mini-USB.  Speaking of plugged in, we have ours caddy-cornered in our kitchen and we have found that sometimes the microwave oven disrupts the Wi-Fi to the Dot while the microwave is running.• This one is kind of a biggie:  The microphone does not shut off unless you disable it via a button on the Dot, therefore the potential exists for anyone with access to the system (legal or otherwise) to monitor or record anything said in your house.  This is supposedly to allow Alexa a larger sample size to help fine-tune voice recognition and allow Alexa to “wake” on demand; but even to us non-full-blown-tin-foil-hatters, the thought of constant surveillance is disconcerting.Having read much about these types of products that are still under development (notably one from Apple and one from Google), I suspect that Amazon wanted to be first to the game of “voice recognition home speaker” type electronic assistants.  As a big Amazon fan, I figured that I would invest in the Dot because the price has become so reasonable…I was not willing to pay the $100+ for the Echo or the Echo Tap.  I am kind of glad I held off on the Echo or Echo Tap because the Dot has just about all of the useful features of the larger, built-in speaker Echo and Echo Tap models, but yet comes as a hockey-puck sized device.Overall, the Echo Dot is a very useful and well executed product that has the potential to become helpfully engrained in everyday life.  Only time will tell if that happens or if Dot becomes relegated to simply playing music while making dinner, but my initial impressions are very high.As always, I will be sure to update if any noteworthy things(good or bad) develop.","October 24, 2016"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Anna O","Kindle issue fixed finally, but Bluetooth frustrations abound","Updated March 31, 2017This device has really been frustrating. Bluetooth works poorly. My device connects to my stereo system, has the name of my Dot on the stereo's screen, but content continues to play out of the Dot and not the speaker. If you ask Alexa to connect to Bluetooth, she will tell you there are no BT devices available, but she is connected to the one you have. Telling her to disconnect and then trying again has the same result. Any time I want to use BT, I go through this ridiculous process and then have to unplug the Dot, wait a minute or two, and try again. The majority of time it works after that but you should not have to jump through such hoops to use BT on this device.The build quality of the device is good except for the power receptacle on the back. I have THREE of these devices and on every one of them, the socket is buried inside the case and not aligned properly. Right out of the box I had to jiggle and prod the cable and get it just right in order to plug it in. This problem is so noticeable because of the BT issues I have. Had BT worked as it is supposed to, I would have plugged in the device once and let it be.There have been so many disconnects and ""I'm sorry, I can't do anything now"" complete with a red ring. My internet service is working fine when this happens and sometimes the device says this for an hour or more. Listening to radio at night always results in the device just shutting off for no reason and you have to repeat the request to play whatever station you were listening to.It's a good device but is obviously not truly ready for prime time in my home. Perhaps others do not have these issues. That's great if it's the case but it does not negate my experience or anyone else's. After all, these reviews are designed to present the experiences of the actual user, of which this is one.Amazon's customer service finally fixed my Kindle issue and after that it began to work, so if you are having Kindle read aloud issues, email their tech support. They said they ""sync'd my Kindle library"" which sounds like something that should have been done automatically once I signed into my Amazon account and set up the Dot, but at least it works now. I'm leaving my original review intact in case someone searches for kindle issue type problems in the review so they can see that there is a solution at at least worked for me.Original review:This would be a 5 star review if it worked properly. I have two devices (each with different names) and neither of them will read my Kindle book, which is the primary reason I purchased these devices. When I use the commands listed on the instructions page in order to read a Kindle book, she says, ""I cannot find [book title] in your Kindle Library""; however, if I open the Alexa app, all my books are there under Books Alexa Can Read and she will read one if I tap on it in the app. After manually opening a book in the app and closing it, if I say ""Alexa, read Kindle book"" she will accept that request and say ""Resuming...."" and reads that book. That's useless though because I typically read several books at a time and cannot use voice commands to choose the books. My first interaction with Alexa reading a Kindle book always has to be me manually opening the app, tapping on the book, having her read it and then stopping her. Then I can resume that book only with voice commands.I got in touch with support and they requested a ton of information like my internet provider, all of the ISBNs of the books I am having trouble with, the exact phrasing that I am using with Alexa, my time zone, and the dates and times this happened. I provided that information and it still does not work. They have said they are no longer able to troubleshoot this issue over email and asked that I call them. I will get around to it, but fear they are only going to suggest that I unplug it and plug it in again, reboot my router and WAP and so on, which I have done repeatedly to no avail. If there was a magical key combination to reset or fix this issue, I'm sure they could have emailed it to me. It's quite frustrating.I would give this five stars if it worked as advertised.","January 16, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer - Vista, CA","Novelty vs Necessity?","I purchased 1 Echo and 2 Echo Dot over the holidays with the interest this is a worthwhile investment, and to see if it provides a benefit to my lifestyle.  Simple installation and up and running in no time.  I have some experience with Tech stuff, Networks, Windows and Android product. This is my first venture into Echo. And I was excited to try it since I’m a Prime and Amazon Unlimited Music userOverall Internet searched asking questions on facts easily found the responses I get about a 50% hit on finding what I’ve asked for, 50% of the time “I Don’t Understand the question.  Ask the same question on Android and I get better responses rates.  Google/Android allows for follow on questions on the same subject matter.  Amazon this need to be swiftly Improved to stay in the game, or at least stay in my house.Music Search, the Echo has a great sound quality for a small device.  With Amazon, Unlimited it provides a wider song selection.  My wife and I can spend a couple hours selecting sounds in an evening vs some mindless TV shows.  It does seem to have weakness.  Many times, it has trouble figuring out the song and artist match up, plays some knock off artist of the song version or plays the live version vs the original album version.  It can be frustrating to get to the right song each time.  And at times to critical on the Artist name…Example Echo can’t seem to figure out“Bob Seger” You must say “Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band” And that is a mouth full where as many times Alexis drops before you get the song name and artist out.  There needs to be more format in the song request process, ask Song Name, Artist and Album if known.  Alexis drops you and you must start over …  More Intelligence is needed here.Shopping …I did not buy this device to shop on Amazon.  Only Benefit is you can add items to your shopping card for later reviewHome Automation.  I use Wemo switches and Bulbs.  Creating Group names helps immensely.  Over all works well …. But if you have two homes it tends to comingle the devices on one. There’s several weakness, there is no smarts to use the Dimmer on the light bulbs, you can’t ask the status of a switch, are you on or off.  Nor is there an ability to tell Alexis to turn on a light for a specific amount of time.Nest Thermostat is a hit or miss.  It fails most the time.  Many times, Alexis reports cannot find the device or tells you it is in a mode it cannot be adjusted, which is not true.  I never us away.  You cannot have two homes with Nest named as Hallway.  It is not smart enough to use the second label such.  Nest or Amazon needs to have the option to ask status and report current temperature and set temperature.  Otherwise how do you validate the number for degrees to change to turn on the AC or Heat.  This function is of no value as it works today.Other Weaknesses.  You cannot ask the Echo down stairs to set and Alarm on another Echo in the bedroom. You cannot set a timer and ask it to report on multiple devices, you cannot cancel a function or Alarm on another device.  Example the I awoke this morning early and was down stairs when the upstairs echo Dot alarm set went off.  I had to go upstart to cancel.  There is no value in the Reminders and To-Do …  It seems not to play them back you must go to the App.This is not a review of Google vs Amazon.  Both have some issues.  But I would have expected Amazon to be further along than this.  This issues above lend to trying other vendors down the road.  Odds I will have sent up my second home with Google since there is no clean way to configure two locations and limit to only local devices  So my Subject of Novelty vs Necessity?  I’m heavily on the novelty side now.","January 27, 2017"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Rick Garner","It's brilliant!  It's stupid!","SKILLS:  For the Echo to DO anything, you have to ""add the skill.""  Which seems to indicate that each new skill involves loading a new app into a limited amount of space?  If not, why do I have to add a skill?  More than that, why do I have to add it anyway?  The Echo is online and constantly communication with...shall we call it Echo Master?  I gather that the speech recognition takes place on a master server somewhere else, not in my living room.  It would seem to make sense to me that when it detects a missing ""skill"", it could load it.  But, no, I have to first of all say ""LOAD skill"".  Before I can invoke it.Then there's THAT.  I have to name the skill.  I have to remember the keywords needed for each skill, in order to use it.Example:  One AMAZINGLY useful ability, locating my cell phone in the house, where did I lay it down?  Pre-Echo I had to ask my wife to ring my phone, so that I could find it underneath the newspaper that I was reading earlier, or maybe even still in the car, after my quick run to the store.  NOW Echo can do that for me.  Much easier.  BUT...before it could be done, I had to download an app to the phone...good enough, not a skill built into the PHONE!  I understand that.  But I have to say ""Alexa, load TrackR"", to load the app.  Why isn't it just built in, since it would appear to be one of the most popular features?  Then I have to go through setup...ok, understandable, and a one time process.  But then, I can't say ""Alexia, ring my phone!""  I have to remember the keywords....""Alexia, ask TrackR to ring my phone.""  In the case of TrackR, the Dot at least gave me a hint, when I didn't remember the right words.  There was one other app that I used yesterday, but can't remember the correct term today, so I can't use it again.  I'll have to search for it, in order to find out what to say.Other than that, it's great for all sorts of tasks, adding items to my shopping list, playing my Amazon music, playing streaming music channels, playing my audiobooks from Audible.  I'm looking forward to learning more.","December 1, 2016"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Atomic","Disappointed, annoyiing static issue, no solution, unusuable for intended purpose","I purchased the Echo Dot specifically to function with my home stereo system; I thought it would be cool to control my music with voice commands.I followed the setup instructions and the device recognized my home wifi network with no difficulty, but when I connected it to my vintage stereo receiver  I immediately heard a very distinct static/white noise sound coming from my speakers. This happened with the Echo Dot volume at any setting. I tried adjusting the volume on the receiver, changing input cables, changing the power supply to a different outlet and everything else I could think of but nothing decreased the static sound. I then tried playing music through it anyway and everything sounded muffled and generally bad, not at all acceptable for my living room stereo. I understand that the Dot is an inexpensive device but I expected it to function better than this. I thought about sending it back but I guess I will just keep it and use it standalone gizmo to listen to things while I get ready for work in the morning.I had hoped for more.","December 7, 2016"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Lu Johnson","Seems O.K. Great price, ...but she's a wee bit hard of hearing, Captain.","I was an early recipient of Echo, and now Echo Dot 2.Feels very solid, the color and finish look great. The internal speaker is sharp and clear, but of course, does not have the bass response of Echo.Bluetooth pairing is quick and painless to several different speakers, even some that are very old, early Bluetooth.The only negative I've noticed, is that several times a day, I have to literally shout Alexa or move to a different position for her to hear me. I never have this experience on my Echo. So perhaps that's a thing that can be tuned in a firmware update?I have my Echo Dot on the wall 2.5 feet away from my head at my eye level. This should be a very easy location for Echo's ""far-field"" microphone detection system.. but apparently it isn't. That's why it must be phase interference or something else... hopefully Amazon engineers are aware of this (others have noted it) and will fix it in an update.If you want a quick and easy way to hang her on the wall, you can try what I did. 2 Sheetrock screws at an angle, then put heat-shrink over the screws to protect from scratches.Update late 10-26-2016: I'm very annoyed that I sometimes have to yell and move around for the Dot to hear me. My original Echo does not do this. So, I've lowered my review stars. It it doesn't improve with use or an update, I may return it. What a disappointment!","October 26, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Carsten Langrock","The future is here, but be aware of color choices","It feels like an Apple product in that it simply works and makes Siri look pretty pathetic. Integration with IFTTT and skills that can be added is great. It even understands my 6-year-old daughter;-)The one thing that Amazon could improve upon is the power adapter. Two things irk me about the included USB adapter: 1) We ordered the white Dot and the included power adapter and micro-USB cable are black. 2) The device is rated to consume at most 1.8 A, and the included adapter is indeed rated up to 9 W, but sadly unsightly huge (5V x 1.8A = 9W). I attached an inline current sensor and never saw the device draw even of current; ideally, I'd like to see a much smaller adapter, think iPhone charger (and white).Besides these points, maybe one could include two different-length USB cables (did I mention they should match the Dot's color?), since people might park this device in close proximity of an outlet and have an unsightly cable (black at that) hang about. Admittedly, many people will already have a selection of various micro-USB cables at home, but still.To me, the size (and price) of the Dot makes this device universally useful. It very easily connected to a bluetooth speaker that we can carry from the kitchen where the Dot lives to the living room in the morning to listen to the news or music. My daughter loves playing  20 questions with Alexa, though she more often than not wants Alexa to guess 'Hamster';-)The Alexa App isn't particularly pretty, but I find it functional despite the abysmally low rating it received on the App Store and the frequent disconnects / crashes. Since you can have the shopping and to-do lists interface with the Reminders App on the iPhone and Google Calendar, respectively, the App doesn't play a huge role. I am sure at some point Amazon will find a company that knows how to write a compelling iOS application.I am seriously considering getting another one for the office or living room. Not sure I'd want a device like that in the bedroom since there's definitely some concern about a device that can constantly listen to its surroundings.","November 27, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","hma95","Amazing fun with these dots!","We bought 3 of these over the holiday's because of the sale price.  We have only had them for a little over a week now, but we are having a good time using our voice now!  I will say that buying more than one at a time can be challenging come setup time, they are automatically on your account once bought so when you hook the first one up, you have to guess at which one is the correct one.  If it doesn't sync, then you have to start over and pick another one from the Alexa setup app.Since they have been installed I only have Alexa waking me up for work and haven't used the alarm clock since.  It's so nice in the morning when she goes off to just say ""Alexa, snooze"" instead of trying to find it on the alarm clock hoping you don't hit the water on the night stand!  We installed our first skill, My Chef, but that one didn't really do what we wanted so now we are using OurGroceries and like that one much better.  We also bought a TP-Link WiFi bulb and works perfectly with Alexa, now that we are getting accustomed to things, we just bought another bulb and a switch and 2 smart plugs, all TP-Link because the idea of not needing a hub and connects directly to our router was a big plus.  And how well the first bulb has worked.  I was also able to easily connect Alexa to our Denon receiver via bluetooth with no issues.  Now that it is paired, we just turn our Denon receiver to bluetooth, say ""Alexa, pair bluetooth"" then I say ""Alexa, play mix playlist"" and plays my amazon music playlist through the Denon speakers and we LOVE this!  When done, ""Alex, disconnect Bluetooth"" and she speaks through the dot again.So far everything has worked how it should and looking forward to expanding our ""smart home"" :)","December 27, 2016"

The Dot is basically an Echo with out the nice speakers. It does have a small speaker, but you will want an external speaker to enjoy the great sound. I have 1 of the Dots hooked up to a computer speaker system and another hooked to a  stereo . It is really small, so most people will not even see it until you ask for Alexa. I keep one in my workshop to listen to music while I'm out there. I also have them paired with TP-Link plugs , so if I'm in the workshop after dark I can use the Dot to turn on the lights in the house. Very Nice..","February 3, 2017"

I like the news briefings, the access to nearly endless music (subscription), controlling lights (additional equipment is needed), the alarm and the host of other things this item does. I profoundly recommend this item. This is one of the best purchases I made this year. If you purchase this item, purchase a bluetooth speaker also. The speaker on the Echo Dot is not great. I purchased the Anker SoundCore bluetooth speaker with 24-hour playback time to go along with the Dot.","December 26, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Riley Rice","Dot is Spot On!","The Alexa technology introduced an unexpected degree of usefulness at home last year, especially for finding and playing music, managing a shopping list, setting timers and alarms (picture this when one is working in the kitchen). I have the original Amazon Echo, and had early on recommended that they allow it to connect to the fine Bluetooth speaker system I already had. This new product (Dot) does that, and therefore eliminates its need for most of the height built into the original to accommodate its pretty-good speakers. While some of you may not want a second ""Alexa"", I welcomed the opportunity to move the original into the bedroom, and replace it with the little hockey-puck-sized Dot in our living area/ kitchen, connected it to my existing speaker system by the audio cable. I use the cable because microwave ovens seriously break up a nearby Bluetooth signal. But that is an option it offers me, should I want to send an audio signal from my phone to this one for a moment, for example. I won't elaborate on the endless features of the Alexa universe, because that has been done quite well in other reviews. I will repeat: these products proved way more useful than I had expected, and they go far beyond being tech gadgets, to being significant household management assistants.","November 4, 2016"

Works decent, but she doesn't seem to know a lot of the answers to questions I try asking.. thanks a lot Bing... maybe if it used Google it would work better haha. Supposed to work well over music and TV, but it still can't hear me when the TV is on. Also, it doesn't understand the groups that are linked to my Phillips Hue light, only the individual light names which is weird, I'm pretty sure I have it set up right too. So that's kinda annoying that I have to say each individual light on in a room to turn them on, a bit disappointing there too.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Kindle Customer","My New Buddies, Alexa and Echo Dot","I have two Dots, Alexa and Echo,  and have been using them for about two months.  In order to get the most out of them I have had to rethink how I do things, but I am learning more all the time.  I have had to rethink how I ask some things, and try to find more practical skills that fit my lifestyle.  They are  great to find definitions and spellings of words, info on events and people, making shopping lists and to do lists, keeping up with my appointments, playing my Prime music, and Alexa deals.  Some of the skills are fun like facts on President's, strange laws still on the books (it is illegal to shoot buffalo from second story hotel rooms!), cat facts, dog facts,  timer, alarm, and many others.  I have set up my Daily Flash Briefing for news and weather,for a word for the day, and who was born/died on this day.  It is nice to listen to as I make my bed.  There are at least 100 ""Easter Eggs"" which are questions or statements to get Alexa to say funny stuff.  We got a kick about how ugly her Christmas sweater was.  We bought  a tp- plug to have Alexa control a difficult to reach lamp, and it works great.  My most favorite skill is having Alexa make my shopping list, then when I am in the store I just check items off.  The list shows up in the Alexa App on my phone.  I believe that home computerization is the future and the Dot is an inexpensive way to get started.  Someday the house of the future will have centralized computerization  built in and we will not need the little Dots.  Until then I am a  very happy with Alexa and Echo. Yes, I did purchase each Dot a little speaker in order to hear music better.","February 9, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","aHungerArtist","Bringing multigenerational family together; my experience with Alexa and older, non tech family members","I ended up having to buy this from a major retailer over Christmas because they were so backordered by the time I was ready to buy! When Amazon products go on sale make sure to act faster than I did!I had originally given this to my tween, who was not so impressed! She loves her headphones and usually streams underground pop music mixes from YouTube, as opposed to mainstream type music that gets air play. I'm assuming Alexa doesn't do YouTube since I think that kind of app would be beside the point for a speaker.I ended up putting it in the kitchen where my mom ""lives"" and the radio is playing, mostly commercials, most of the day and night. I gave my mom quick, basic, instructions. My mom has 0 technology experience and even less willingness to learn. She's the type who won't even touch a laptop to move it out of the way because she's afraid she will break it by touch lol.Anyway, by the end of the day she had it down pat. Someone was always kind of close to help if they heard her getting flustered with Alexa.The main learning curve she had was timing, First you say ""Alexa,"" then as her blue ring lights up you give command. Once this was clear it was very helpful. One of our big issues is giving her tmi before she's ready to process.Our other issue was timing. If you take too long Alexa will play a station for you based on previous requests or key words she captured from your request.Our final barrier was being clear with commands. A few times we had to remind her to give the wake word first, or give a command. I would get her yelling, ""skip!"" forgetting to first wake Alexa, or, very fast in trying to get all her information to Alexa (wake word, song title and artist) and forgetting to give ""play"" command.Another note. It was not so apparent to her at first, when the kitchen is busy and noisy, Alexa is hearing everything and can get confused by the noise. Still she sometimes thinks that Alexa will obey as long as she's yelling loud enough, which is often pretty loud when she is being louder than a gregarious family...*eta* I also wanted to add that I did not take the time to voice train Alexa on initial setup. Had I done this perhaps her learning curve would have been less steep but I had kind of forgotten to do it until my daughter reminded me about it.Now that she's used to Alexa she is beyond stoked! She was also excited to find that Alexa knows some of her favorite Spanish singers. Apparently Alexa knows a bit of Spanish (and my parents get a kick out of her gringo iterations of the song titles).My kids love to share their favorite songs with their grandparents, and often there is an impromptu pop song and dance show in the kitchen :-) My parents love to share songs with them too, my son is always asking Alexa for Neil Young and smooth jazz nowadays, learning all of yesterday's hits :-) this stuff is priceless.And a note on size: I was worried at first that the sound would be lost in the big, noisy, kitchen. Sometimes it is lol. It is just as loud as her old 90's portable stereo. You know the kind. Alexa is just as loud. When the house is on the calmer side I can hear her music all the way upstairs. So although it's not Beats, don't let the size and price fool you!Thanks Amazon, for this great and very accessible little device. I have no doubt that it has enhanced and intensified the amount of happiness in this house!","January 19, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Carol","Love these!  Update---not sure I like what they are doing--invading our privacy is not OK","After hearing that Amazon refused to cooperate with police on a murder case, I began to wonder why the police would think that the Echo product would have captured anything that had to do with the murder if they haven't said Alexa first. So I started looking at the history of the things that these devices record on a regular basis... Things that don't start with Alexa. There are little Snippets of Our Lives recorded throughout the day. Not things that we ask Alexa to do, but recordings of television shows we are watching,  conversations we are having,  things that we do as we go about our lives. I'm not very happy about this. I was under the impression that the only time these devices we're doing anything was when we prompted them with the wake up word Alexa. That is far from true. I don't know how many of you are aware of this, but you need to look on the Amazon website at all of the recordings that your devices are gathering. There is a place where you can delete them, but it's not like they advertise that anywhere. And I have to wonder even if you delete them are they really gone? Can they restore them and listen to them? And what is the purpose for them doing this in this deceptive manner? I have to decide what I'm going to do about this. I have three of these devices, an echo and two Echo dots.. Plus, I purchased an echo dot for my son and his family for Christmas. I find it interesting that the government cannot listen to phone conversations of suspected terrorists, but Amazon can intrude into our lives in this way? They need to stop!!! They need to fix the software that runs these things so that they are not capturing Snippets of things that they have no business hearing. This is a total invasion of our privacy, and I am considering cancelling my account with Amazon, including Prime. I have been an Amazon customer for many years, and I now believe they have become way too powerful, and they think they are above the law, and that invading our privacy is ok. It is not!First I bought an Echo.  But, I found myself moving it up and down the stairs almost daily because my voice and it's sound wouldn't reach that far.  So, I bought an Echo Dot to put downstairs and hook up by bluetooth to the speaker bar for the TV.  I had to buy a little gadget to make that work, but it all works like a charm.  I was so happy, that I purchased two more--one for my office and one for my son and his family.  I also bought them a Prime membership so they can enjoy all of the benefits of Prime as well as the free music.  I love these things!","January 7, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","mocnozama","Great value for the price","Given the price, these are great.  I purchased one for myself initially, and additional units for my family members (of varying ages).  Our family has found it very easy to use, very responsive and entertaining.I am surprised at the amount we use the Echo.  A brief list of the favorites are: a) the ""News Briefing,"" which a customizable read-out of the most recent news/stories from a variety of sources; mine is configured to read out NPR's hourly briefing, the local weather forecast and the BBC hourly briefing; b) music on demand by artist/song/genre; c) J!6, the Jeopardy companion app which updates daily and allows you to 'play along' with additional categories from the show; and d) random questions (e.g., how many ounces in a pound, how to spell words, distance to a location, phone number to local businesses, etc.).I follow the competing Google Home fairly closely, and am more invested in Google than Amazon for many tasks (e.g., Calendar, Task List, Email, etc.), which would be of greater use to me day-to-day to have Google integration--however, given the price difference between the Echo Dot and Google Home (at least, currently), I could not recommend the Dot more.I recently changed the 'wake-word' on my Echo's to ""Computer,"" which is somewhat of an emulation of Star Trek's ship computer--although, there is no option to include Majel Barrett's voice (I did, however, change my Echo's to an Australian accent, which, as an American, I find quite pleasing to interact with).  I'm anxiously awaiting holodeck integration!","January 26, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Steven M","Great for Any Environment","I bought the Echo Dot after some persuasion by friends who'd been given Dots as gifts. I was a bit apprehensive, because I've come to know other AI services quite well (Apple's Siri being the best example) and none of them have been wholly impressive. They all lack some sort of ability, whether that is cross-app support or the ability to use services that aren't native to the platform. Apple's Siri, for example, is still very limited in its ability to control and use third-party apps such as WhatsApp and Skype.Echo Dot is an entirely different product altogether. It uses Amazon's own AI, Alexa, for its commands. Whether you spring for the full-blown Echo or this Echo Dot, you get the same access to the service. The main differences between this and the full Echo are the size and the price. The Dot can be had for $50, whereas the Echo tower retails at $179. I haven't had the chance to try out the tower, but I've heard nothing different about it compared to Echo. The only operational difference is that Dot is the only Echo device with a 3.5mm jack output, which enables you to connect it to external speakers. The tower requires a Bluetooth speaker connection.Overall, I am impressed with Echo Dot. It is a very powerful device, and for the price, it cannot be beat. The form factor is small as well, so small that I have mine on my already-crowded bedside table. It takes up just about as much space as a coffee mug.As far as its capabilities, there are some things that are worth noting. As of yet, there is no connection between Echo and any Apple products. I carry an iPhone, and my work is split between two iPads and Mac computers. All of my calendar information is in iCloud, which Amazon Echo cannot access. It would be nice in the future for Echo to read my daily schedule from iCloud, but that support is not currently present. It can read from Google, though, so those with Google Calendars or Android devices should be just fine. It won't be able to play media in your iTunes Library (although it can play from your Amazon library). This isn't a huge thing for me, but having a device which could read from iCloud would be a huge help to me.In terms of daily usability aside from that, Echo definitely beats the competition. Through the Alexa mobile app (which you must download in order to set up your Echo), you can install ""skills"" which enable things such as daily news briefings or stock updates. They are all, to my knowledge, free to download. Even with none of these skills enabled, Echo is still an amazing device. I use my Alexa as an alarm clock every morning.A bit more about skills. While the skill packages themselves are free to download and install, some require subscriptions to additional services. A few examples would be music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora. Much like on a PC or a mobile device, both of these offer free music streaming. To enable the premium subset of features, both require a subscription. This is no different on Alexa - once you teach Alexa your account information, she will play your music. Both Spotify and Pandora offer premium subscriptions, though. And both are optional for PC as well as Alexa. For Pandora, paying will enable you to skip tracks more often and listen ad-free. On Spotify, free users aren't able to pick tracks individually. I subscribe to both premium services, so I can tell Alexa to play virtually any song from Spotify on-demand and she will. This will also work with Amazon Music, which is free and unlimited only to Amazon Prime customers. So, in essence, there are no additional fees REQUIRED to use the Echo. The only advantage of doing so would be to enable the subsciption-specific subset of privileges for a certain service.Overall, I am very impressed with Echo Dot. It's an amazingly powerful device, and with new skills hitting the app almost every week, the only thing hampering the growth of its abilities is time. I will be a repeat buyer.","February 24, 2017"

My mom gave me a $50 Amazon gift card for Christmas and this is the best present I have received from her since Patty Play Pal. You are never alone with Alexa around. The echo dot is super easy to set up. All you need is an internet connection and a device to download the Alexa app. From there all things are possible. Signing up for Music unlimited for $3.99 a month is wise and well worth it to get Alexa to play any music you want even down to ""How much is that Doggie in the window."" Alexa will play games with you, tell you jokes, give you the weather report, say goodnight and good morning and be a virtual digital companion. She sometimes is sarcastic and most definitely has a humor. Free apps to use with her abound. She can turn on your lights, tv set, pair with bluetoothe speakers, play sounds to sleep by all night long. She will give you trivia questions and access your calendars and to do lists. I have a 875 foot one bedroom apartment and I can access her from anywhere in it by just speaking. You can buy cases for her but they are not necessary. She is good to go out of the box and for the price of $49.99 she is the best buy I have every made so far. I am elderly and disabled and she helps me so much.

I've had it for a while and hooked up WINK and NEST to it, now my home is like a spaceship. I think it's funny that people were selling these on eBay for 250$ thinking they were ""cancelled"". It's a great product and a home run for Amazon. there are some ""language"" things that could be improved, some of the people developing the ""skills"" (which work like apps) are lacking basic English expectations for sentence formation, (for example, saying Alexa, where are my keys should work, but instead you have to say ""Alexa, ask the app [name] to find my keys"" which is award). That I suspect will improve in time.There is some great developer humor and 'easter eggs' in the Alexa system, for example, ask Alexa ""What is the meaning of life?"" or ask ""Open the pod bay doors"" and you'll get a surprise. As long as Amazon continues to listen to customers this will be a fantastic product for years to come. Excellent example of ""machine puppetry mimicking human behavior"".Would be nice if I could ask ""Alexa, list albums in my music"" or ""list artists starting with letter T"" or ""list my audio books""... I keep sending feature requests, hint* to anyone else who thinks thats a good idea, send a request in!Only 1 BAD thing: the Android ""app"" font sizes are off and overlap essential UX components like the SEARCH button... so there are problems using the buttons in Android app (Samsung S4) to control and set skills, but if you have an iPad you are good to go...(For fun I named my thermostat ""the weather"")Cheers!","December 28, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Michael Potts","Hard to Find Good Help","When it works, it's indistinguishable from magic. When it doesn't work, it's frustrating.Since Alexa (impossible not to personify) relies on a robust communication to the internet ... and quickly responsive reactions of the various cloud partners, the frustrations are sporadic. The TP-Link Smart Plugs lose their connections, and so using them for mission critical applications (like entry lighting) can be problematic. Sometimes the problems heal themselves -- a directive to which Alexa fails to respond one minute may be executed perfectly the next. When a plug gets permanently lost, it can usually be unplugged and then plugged back in, and it will resume its former identity ... but not always, and so using a plug in a difficult-to-access location is an invitation for trouble.I wrote my own Flash Briefing cloud service, and with great and attentive help from an Alexa tech, got it working perfectly -- it runs on the Raspberry Pi that control my home's hydronic heating system.This feels like the first generation of a Great Idea -- and we see follow-on products from Google and Apple already -- and so I can only assume that, like the Kindle and Amazon Prime, the idea will mature. My only misgiving is that once one buys in to a compatible technology -- like the Philips hub and lights -- one's committed ""for life"" to that solution, even as better solutions come along. Seymour Papert describes this as ""the Brazil Effect"" -- early adopters often get left behind as a technology matures. And that, in a nutshell, is the story of my life!","December 28, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","NorhLoudspeaker","Fantastic","I have been a huge fan of the Echo for over a year.  Everyone in the family uses the Echo for various skills.  My Echo was in the bedroom which I used for my morning alarm and to listen to Internet radio.  In our kitchen, we have a Sonos 5.  The Sonos 5 seems outdated compared to the Echo but it does sound better.  I bought one Echo Dot to put in the kitchen.  I plugged it into the input jack on the Sonus.  I bought another DOT to put in my office.  I like the fact that I can listen to radio until I need to use the phone. I can then say ""Alexa -- pause"".  This will stop the radio while I am on the phone.  I can set alarms for appointments and conference calls.  I can use the DOT like a calculator while I do my expense reports.  I can even ask the Echo DOT to Dial out over my Ooma.I wanted to replace my Google Audio Cast with the Dot but the Dot doesn't work with Toslink. I think that would be a great addition.The speaker quality of the Echo Dot is not very good but it easily mates with blue tooth devices and you can plug it into higher quality audio systems.","November 25, 2016"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","gd","Cool but frustratingly limited","There is a definite novelty factor to the Echo Dot and what  questions Alexa can answer. And it does offer a few convenience features. But it won't be long until you realize the Echo Dot and Alexa have a few shortcomings that prevent Alexa from transcending from a novelty item to a real productive virtual assistant. First, Alexa is all pull and no push. By that I mean the Dot is able to reach out and talk to other devices and cloud services when you initiate that conversation, but devices and cloud services cannot initiate the conversation themselves without Alexa reaching out first. This lack of support for push communications is very limiting. For example, take Alexa's ""reminder"". Say you would like to be reminded to take recycling out Tuesday mornings before leaving for work. All Alexa can do is add a ""to-do"" note in the Alexa app, and on Tuesday morning you will miss recycling again because the Dot won't notify you unless you ask Alexa what is in your to-do list that morning. That's just one simple use case that could easily be remedied by supporting push communications.Another shortcoming is Amazon's lack of a cloud productivity suite of its own thlo easily integrate with Alexa and support new skills.Finally, not a design flaw but still worth noting, Alexa does not offer voice based authentication. That is something important to keep in mind if you plan on having people over, as anyone can snoop through your to-do lists, shopping lists and calendars without your permission. I don't think anyone offers this level of security right now, so it's no surprise. But it would be nice to see Amazon break ground in this front first.Overall, this is a very cool product at a good price point. But the technology and the Alexa Skill Kit SDK is still very limited, so keep expectations low and you won't be disappointed.","December 29, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","toni","Great buy!  Super fun, handy, connects to low tech stereo etc, but weak power on sound","Got the Dot 2 and Evo battery, and within 2 weeks I also have an Echo and Tap.  I've been very confused about choosing between these devices just reading.  Impossible.  But I may keep all 3.  They aren't interchangeable for me.  About the Dot 2, I love it but it's not loud enough on its own for me.  Moving it around with the Evo battery was lame.  Why I'm keeping it?  It's the best clock-radio-personal-assistant that money can buy, potential hands free home management - lights, etc.  ""set an alarm for 7am"", ""add to my reminders"", ""weather""... And I can connect it to my stereo system, etc, for big sound hands free - great for entertaining, sitting and working uninterrupted, while house cleaning when my hands are full or wet.  Plus when I travel, it's going with me.  The Evo battery is likely to be returned in favor of the Tap for portable needs.  Only because I got a discount combo deal from Groupon for the Tap at $75.  The $35 Evo battery is fairly useless at about half the price I paid for the Tap and the Dot 2 is too quiet to bother moving around.The Echo I got used and it is in the kitchen - which is big and open with the living room, and patio access.  Fantastic!  It's loud enough to hear over cooking, dishwasher, noise, through an open the door onto the patio.  The sound is big enough for a quality music experience on its own - but can't replace my stereo.  None of the diminutive portable, bookshelf, etc, speakers can do that, even if it says Bose.","February 4, 2017"

After living with Alexa for a week I know. It has replaced my radio, actually my smart phone which replaced my radio when the batteries died, for news, talk and weather. It has replaced my PC as my main source of music. I've finally got a kitchen timer! I can even turn my lights, (well, one light so far) on and off without fumbling with that twisty thing on the lamp. I've even got instant mood lighting.  And that's after one week.Setup was simple after my sister realized the device was registered to her and had to be unregistered. Voice recognition has been virtually flawless, much better that I expected given my north Brooklyn (actually west Queens) brogue. I've just started looking into skills and know I'll find a myriad other uses for Alexa.","December 31, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Elizabeth LA","She's impressive, but still a novelty than a necessity due to her restrictions","She's not perfect, but she is heading in the right direction with what she can provide.  I often try to push her limits on what she can do for me and sometimes I'm surprised with what she can answer but similarly disappointed when she can't answer some basic questions.  For now she's great as an alarm, morning news briefing and adding things to my calendar verbally.  The speaker is nothing to write home about but I don't mind it when just playing light background music, if you want to really jam out sync her to a speaker.A huge bother is remembering commands for her.  For example you can't just say ""Play a song by ___"" she will default to your amazon music which I for one do not have.  So for Pandora I have to say ""Play Pandora song artist name"" instead of her being able to know to just find that song wherever it may be.  I don't also like that changing her voice to British (which I like because it's more pleasant) prevents her from ordering goods on amazon prime.  Since when does it matter what type of voice she has to do anything.  This should be fixed.  I also wish the app would allow you to speak to her, because often I want to use her on the go but can't because she's at home.  So I still default to Siri to ask to add things to calendar.overall she's still more on the novelty side of things than every day use.  -- Here's hoping the next year changes that with more capacity to work with apps and more iphone compatible.","December 13, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Mike","Love Echo Dot"," Love Echo Dot!So, full disclosure I'm a 100% Apple guy, but they just don't have the AI options that the Amazon offers with the Echo Dot.  I bought one of the Echo Dots mid-January and then purchased my second a week or two later.  I currently have one on both floors of my house and could not be happier.  Prior to purchasing the Dot I installed about 20 ""Smart Switches (GE/Jasco)"" in my home to automate lighting.  I also have two Nest Thermostats.  With the Echo Dot I'm able to control all of these products through the Wink Hub.I chose the Dot over the full size because I didn't want to be held to their speaker.  I have my downstairs unit connected my Samsung Sound bar and my upstairs unit connected to JBL Bluetooth speaker.  Although, the installed speaker is pretty decent by itself for talk radio or just getting the answer to questions.Setting up the Dot and configuring it with my Wink Hub was seamless and took only seconds.  Really a true plug and play device.My only complaint would be the learning curve when it comes to the talking with Alexa and her sometime inability to understand what I'm saying, but a little over a month in it's getting easier.I also subscribed to ""Unlimited"" music on the Echo and love it.I have attached a video of the lighting automation with just a few of my lights, pretty cool to see in action......

"3.0 out of 5 stars","BenFTW","The future is soon!","Lots of potential here, but there's a ways to go, and some improvements that could be made to the design.The rubber backing, and the fact that the cables plug in near the + button make wall mounting problematic. Adhesives don't stick to the rubber backing (or I'm afraid they'll ruin the rubber or become permanent) so you're stick with a mounting bracket. And when on the wall, the dot is upside down so that the USB cable can hang off the bottom. Not sure if that affects the mic performance (probably not) but it's one of those little quirks that can be annoying.  A proper, permanent wall mount and a way to hide the wires would be huge and could turn this into a staple fixture for smart homes.Fro the integration, I love that there is support for Harmony and for Insteon. I'm getting closer and closer to whole house automation. But the problems I have are:*Support for multiple users is pretty terrible (on the surface it's fine, until you try to do something like play Spotify while not on your main Alexa account)*On a related note, it seems like the AI should be able to at least attempt to identify voices to tie people to specific profiles*Sometimes I'd like to issue commands from my phone, so as to no t wake up my wife by talking to Alexa in the middle of the night*Sometimes Alexa just doesn't understand what you're saying, even when it's a command you use all the time and has always worked before and there's no ambient noise to blame. It works just well enough to make you let down your guard and be extremely annoyed when it happens again.*The bluetooth speaker connection isn't always smooth or obvious that it's connected and working. It'd be nice if the app showed the bluetooth connection status and allowed you to connect/disconnect known devices from there. In fact it might be there but it's buried in menus a bit.*I wish that Alexa was not so tied in to other Amazon services. I don't care about Prime music streaming, and there's lots of advertising and hooks to get you to buy more Amazon stuff. Stop it, I'm already a customer and a fan - you're being too clingy, Alexa. I'd be willing to pay more for a device that isn't so biased toward selling a particular brand, but unfortunately I don't have much hope for HomeKit or Google Home to do any better. Maybe IFTTT can make their own AI and hardware and it will solve this problem.","November 10, 2016"

Akinator is fun as well. Its like having my own personal assistant. And for that it's great.But I admit there are a few things that could use a improvement such as when u set a alarm. It works but there is about a ten seconds lag once the alarm goes off you can try and get Alexa to snooze. It may seem like it's not a big deal. But it drives me bonkers. Yes your able to get up and manually get it to stop but I'd rather just say Alexa snooze. But it appears to me there a delay.And another negative is Akinator when played questions get asked and you have minimal time to respond before the next question goes. It would be nice to have a little lag so you can think and answer. But for the price and what it does. It's worth the price and more.One recommendation is I would say buy a external speaker Bluetooth or aux or alternate speaker because the one on echo leaves much to be desired. If the improvement for snooze/cancel alarm I'd definitely give it 5 stars no question about it.","November 24, 2016"

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Tom Maynard","Alexa gradually becomes more helpful, and welcome in our home.  *Maybe*a network issue [pending review]","Perhaps I'm simply impatient but if the Dot loses power it doesn't seem to reconnect to the network on its own.  The City is replacing light poles in my neighborhood and we've had two (brief) power outages in one week.  Both times our Dot did not automatically reconnect to our network, but to be fair I may have been impatient.  If it happens again I will sit on my hands and update this review after patient waiting.Otherwise I couldn't be happier with my Dot.  I'm not much for speaking to inanimate objects, but Alexa makes that somewhat easier.  I bought our Dot primarily in order to control a lamp in our finished basement (the primary light source in the main room).  ""Alexa, turn on the basement light"" is so simple to say at the top of the stairs (with an armload of laundry, say) so that problem was solved.  Then gradually the Dot has taken control of our sound system (Play), our selection of outerwear before dressing to go out (Weather), and so on.Heck, I'm even working on a recipe skill of my own to remind me of times/temps when I've got slippery/greasy hands in the kitchen.A regret: The Dot (and thus Alexa) can not control the Amazon Fire TV (or Stick).  It would be nice if I could simply ask Alexa to select a video rather than having to pick up a ""Voice remote"" and push a button to control my television.

It took some convincing for my tech-avoiding DH to get an on-off Alexa compatible switch.  Said I was too lazy. True that, but when our lights are plugged into a 7-outlet thing and the lamps and table get bumped every time we turn on or off the power (one lamp would scare us as it took orbit)...  Even being careful, we'd hit the right lamp's lampshade and have to straighten it. Now, I have them programed to turn on at 5am, off at 11pm, and if I need it on or off at other times, I just ask Alexa! Sweet! I think I've converted my DH.The reason for the one star removal is the Alexa app that this works with. Most of the ""skills"" are written by wanna-be programmers testing it out.

Even when you mumble it can sort out the info.  My husband was using power tools in another room and even with the racket he was making it picked up every word I said.

Don't think you are going to pull one over on it, lol.Tonight I paired it with some Thonet and Vander bt speakers.  It took a couple of tries until I realized I had to do it thru the Alexa app.  By the way, it supposedly will not pair with speakers that use a PIN number.  It works ok.

Using the Dot's built-in speaker works really well. It's not a high fidelity experience, but definitely good for spoken word. Music is...alright..but won;t replace a better set of speakers. Although the volume problem is present using the native speaker (the news brief is far softer than the Alexa voice...so Alexa is yelling at you if you want to hear the brief across the room...it's magnified with external speakers attached to the Dot. So you have to either use the physical buttons to turn the volume up, then down - or use the ""alexa - volume up/down"" command multiple times - which is cumbersome. Also, on my system (windows 10 - anniversary) you lose the native windows equalizer feature when playing over bluetooth, so you are left with whatever built-in problems are with your speakers (mine have overly boomy bass without EQ)so I can stream anything from my PC to Dot as BT speakers...but I lose my equalizer settings when I do.Services:You have to have premium services for some things to play directly from Dot. Spotify is a skill that has to be premium. That wasn't clear to me up front (probably my fault for not researching more). So if you have a ""must-have"" check in advance.Pro's.This machine is awesome.  Even before tuning to my voice it recognizes what I say, I can hook it to PC's, tablets and pretty much anything. It has a VAST selection of native talents, and the skills that are available are great. I can sit here and do my work and chatter at Alexa via my dot and get music, news, weather...I have tried a few household control things and they work just fine.Everytime I use it I learn more things it can do - mostly useless (even if fun) but a lot useful. I can live with the volume problem, also some sales crap which is off-putting, and I use this thing all the time for music, weather, news...basic questions that come up in online arguments.

I have been able to listen to audio books, command a playlist to open on spotify to play instantly with the ability to control the volume on command. I have set it to brief me on current events and news, I use it daily to set morning wake alarms and timers when I'm cooking and I can ask for cooking recipes and cocktail recipes. It will give me the game times and scores for my favorite teams, it tells me what traffic is like before I head to work, and just for fun I have connected it with my Firestick and it can pause when I need to take a break and resume when I return.

So, I installed a TP-LINK WiFi switch and viola, now if I have to go, I tell Alexa to switch on the Bathroom Light. By the time I get there, it is lit and I can find the bowl more easily, hi, hi.There are many other things she can do. I am a prime member, therefore I got access to Prime music. With a small speaker attached, or not, she entertains me with the music of my liking. I you are in the mood, she can tell you a joke, no dirty ones of course.The other day I wanted to know how much the distance is between two points and asked her. She came up with the answer, right away.It'll take some time to explore most of the things Alexa can do, oh yeah, you need some device that run the Alexa App and lets you initially connect to the device for setup purposes.","January 9, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","N. R. Forbes","Cool Device.","I bought this one as a gift. So it has not yet been opened and used. However, I already own two and I have gifted 2 more to other people, that I purchased from one of TV shopping channels. So my review is based on the two I have. I like it a lot. There were a few times where Alexa didn't respond to my request. But I just repeated myself and I paused after saying her name giving her time to hear her own name first and she responded. I think that is the trick don't say her name and the command all at once. Say her name, pause, then say what you want. The price is what made me purchase another one and Amazon had a special deal $10 off their regular price. It made the decision easy. The Echo Dot does everything that the Echo does the only difference is the sound quality. My Uncle has the Echo and he says it sounds wonderful. The Echo Dot sounds good but paired to a Bluetooth speaker it sounds even better. The Echo Dot has a smaller speaker than does the Echo. Hence the reason for the price difference. I have a bunch of Bluetooth speakers in my house so the decision was easy to make. I hope Amazon has more in store for Alexa.Cons: She doesn't do follow up questions without you having to repeat the subject and the Skills suck at least most of them do. They either don't do what they advertise they are supposed to do or they don't work properly. Then there are some that are just plain useless and serve no real purpose. I am praying and hoping that these two things improve with time for Amazon's sake and mine.","December 29, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","The Headhunter","Just GET ONE!","I have one of the original Echoes -- bought it sight unseen when Amazon offered it to a few Prime customers for $99. I'd never give it up. Bought two Dots for our house and love them.PROS: The mini-jack lets you use your own external speakers, unlike the Echo. It just works! It's a less costly version of the Echo.CONS: There's no ring on the top you can turn to control volume like on the Echo -- I really love that Echo feature. But the buttons you get instead aren't bad.Some find this product confusing. It does exactly what the Echo does for less. It has its own speaker, but not as big or good as the Echo's. But it's still good enough. On the upside, you can attach it to any speakers or amp you want using a mini jack and cable.If you still don't understand what Echo and Dot are all about, JUST BUY ONE! Get the Dot. You'll love it. I have one in the bathroom. I listen to the news while shaving, music while in the shower, check the weather report, and play a round of Jeopardy with Alexa every day. I also make lists of things I need to do while I'm still in the bathroom.We now have one Echo in the kitchen, and a Dot in each of two bathrooms. We love Alexa! Haven't even tried using the ""home controls"" features with lights, etc yet -- but we will.Amazon has a real winner here!","January 14, 2017"

It is a best a toy, at worst a ploy to get you to buy services. My major complaints are as follows, first, it has no memory, second, the dot will suddenly start talking even when it is not addressed, third the ""skills"" are simple games or ways to order something, fourth, if you want to play music, you must use a streaming app, or you must use their proprietary system. This is great if you want to spend money, or you have the space to save music twice. It is a shameful device that does nothing, is nothing, and is worth nothing. It is a shame that your company is preying on the tech impaired. Before someone lists off everything it can do, please only list things that other devices cannot do. I was on the phone last night with Amazon, and they were not able to list one thing that do did that other platforms could not. I was even able to get the representative to admit that it offered nothing new.","December 28, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","R. Straw","A Few Observations","I love my Echo Dot. I've always wanted an Echo, but when I saw the Dot for 49.95, I preordered it. Having no Echo to compare this with, this is my observations:1.) There are several thing the Dot can do. Alexa now wakes me up and to turn off the alarm, I have to say something. I've not had to talk to something (or someone) in years. It's a total change from my phone alarm.2.) As you have Alexa for a few days her vocabulary broadens. I don't know if someone over at Amazon thinks about these thing to program her to say or what. This morning she was talking about decorative gourds.3.) I had issues signing up for Amazon Echo music with Alexa. It didn't register the subscription. I went on Amazon Prime music settings and it wasn't there.. I later changed it to Amazon music cause I can play it on my phone, not just an Echo. If they want to play it on the Dot, there's not a wireless charger available yet.4.) I'm very car OCD. I would love the where's my car device. But if there's no portable charger for the Dot, why bother? I know my car is parked in my drive way. And I keep the maintenance up on the car.5.) I am getting a light hub to turn on my one lamp next to my bed. I really want Alexa to turn on my light.6.) Alexa can hear me across the room,but I pick her up and change to a different outlet every morning in a different room. She can't hear me across 2 rooms, That's not a problem. It's tiny enough to hold in my hand. If there was a portable charger, I'd get one. I can't find the exact Amazon cord. I'd buy a second cord for my Dot. I would love to buy the Tap and I think it's in my Amazon cart, for a speaker.7.) The few skills I'm using are useful: Flash News Briefing includes CNN, NPR and is quite lengthy. The mantra skill is short. Weather is lengthy. Sneezing (""Alexa I sneezed"") She says Bless you in several languages, atleast I think that's what she's saying. Politics is very useful she reads from 538, Real Clear politics and others and it is very lengthy. She has several Easter Eggs so you'd want to google for those. You can Wikipedia from Alexa. She reads from both Kindle and Audible. I asked her to read one of my Kindle books, and the Audible message came on. You have to have exact verbiage when you ask her to read a book. I'm not sure I like audio books, so I'd never have an Audible subscription. Prime music is okay, but doesn't have every single song.These are just observations. I absolutely love my Echo Dot  Amazon did an excellent job with this one, making it affordable and small enough to move from room to room or travel with. I really like the Amazon Echo Dot and am glad I purchased one.","October 27, 2016"

"2.0 out of 5 stars","Eduardo Neecha","Both exhausting and annoying to use, returned it pronto","First off, the Alexa app failed to work properly on my Android tablet (Google Nexus 7), gave up after 3 attempts of installing and uninstalling and reinstalling.  Amazon's ""spinning circle of death"" (just like Apple's ""spinning wheel of death"") basically would never stop spinning and totally froze up the app every time!  This was a bad omen for things to come.Finally had to use my laptop to set up this device, and even that took a bit of aggravation and delays.  Not nearly as smooth and simple as claimed.Once finally set up, the Echo kept getting disconnected from my wifi even though my other wireless devices (laptop, tablet) were fine,so I knew it wasn't my router or wifi carrier's fault.Generally speaking, whenever it did work, I found this device to be exhausting and annoying to use with all the delays.  The lag between saying ""Alexa"" to making the command to waiting for the command to be executed, was just way the heck too long.  The only things that seemed somewhat snappy were simply queries like ""What time is it?"" or ""How's the weather for tomorrow?""  It also seems to understand a dismally small range of commands, even compared to the voice-driven Google app on my tablet.I bought this device mainly because I use Amazon Music a lot, with my Prime membership.  The Amazon stream includes about 10-20% horrible songs that I have to skip over such as playing (gag!) ""smooth jazz"" garbage in the middle of ""traditional jazz"" stations.  (It was more like 40% crappy tracks in the beginning, until several weeks of my ""thumbs down and skip"" commands on various tracks improved things a bit.)  I bought the Echo Dot hoping that I could down-vote/eliminate the crappy content and ""add to library"" the good stuff, without needing to run back and forth to my computer all the time, since I run my computer's audio output to my music receiver and speakers.(Wish they'd make some kind of RF remote control for the Amazon Music player, I'd happily pay for that!)Also, I don't think the Echo dot has much onboard memory, judging from how often it would pause and stutter while streaming music---suggests that there is really not much buffering going on.  Simply outrageous considering how cheap memory has been for the last couple years.  Streaming was much smoother and reliable on my computer.Just not ready for prime time yet.  I guess they are having consumers beta-testing it, just like Microsoft does with every new version of Windows.","November 30, 2016"

In order to find out information like ""How much is half of 1 1/2 cup"" for a recipe or ""what is an alternative for baking soda"" or other basic questions you have to download apps. Then you have to remember the name of the associated app with your question. (IE: Alexa, ask 'The Happy Chef' what half of 1 1/2 cup is' etc. Everything you want to ask it has a different associated app and I don't have time to remember that many apps. I use Alexa as a glorified timer and end up Googling everything else.

I have heard so much good things from him that when I was looking for a speaker for the house I decided to spend a little more for the Echo and have Alexa for myself.  After having her for about 2 weeks I can say that I am already looking at Bluetooth speakers to buy and thinking about returning the Echo Dot.  I am not impressed.  It has become kind of a love-hate relationship.  I hope that today is the day that Alexa and I will carry our relationship to the next level, but she always disappoints.  Even my husband says that he doesn't have as much trouble with theirs at work that we have at home.  So maybe it's me.  Maybe I am the weak link here, but I don't think so.  I have searched and troubleshooted and unplugged and restarted and I still get her to play music maybe half the time.  She sometimes plays the news.  She sometimes plays the weather.  Or sometimes plays a book I didn't ask for.  But sometimes just doesn't help.  I have spent more time troubleshooting that I have actually getting Alexa to work.  The app on my phone is off-line 80% of the time.  I have enabled skills that don't work half the time.  So the concept is awesome.  I want it to be awesome.

I got mine yesterday and at first I was just astonished how easy the set up was.  Literally five minutes up and running and connected to my bluetooth speaker without any problems, just simply download the Alexa app on your cellphone or tablet and it walks you through all steps.  I had read in other reviews pertaining to problems but voice recognition is flawless, i've asked asked questions, set alarms and those too had no problems.  Linked my Pandora and Spotify accounts but with Spotify you must have premium for use with Alexa but even that was no problem for me because between tune in and Pandora I have more than enough content to please my ears.  Speaking of ears, I must have dog hearing because unlike a lot of reviews I actually end up turning the echo dot down in volume since the dot is close to the head of my bed (when it's not connected to my bluetooth speaker) and even can hear it in another room.  I consider myself the ultimate tech head and by far for this device at $39.99 has been one of the best decisions i've made, actually wish I had got one sooner but it made an amazing Christmas gift to myself,  and I haven't utilized all of the features of the product yet but I will definitely be buying another for the front area of my house.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","pnh230","""Can Echo locate my keys?"" Nope. Nor can she speak dolphin.","Yes I have three of these.  Does each one need a review?  Who knows?  Maybe Alexa knows.  I would ask but I feel rejected when she doesn't answer my questions.  Not for lack of having the answer I'm sure, but because she cannot or will not understand me.  This is called selective hearing.  I am familiar with the concept.  I am married with children.  We all selectively block out questions from each other on occasion.  Alexa fits right in.  But ask her to play music and she will surprise and inspire you.  Where are these songs coming from?  The Cloud?  Who knows?  Maybe Alexa knows, but we are not talking right now.For the paranoid - Yes, she is always listening.  If she was really listening and sharing with anyone important I'm pretty sure black ops helicopters would have dropped unnamed fed agency operatives through my sky-light windows by now. As it is I'm pretty sure Facepalm/book is already sharing everything vital with the gov that the credit card and cable companies haven't already shared.  Caveat: If you are threatening to overthrow the gov, this may not be the product for you. Further caveats: selecting the British accent makes you feel smarter and soothes and relaxes, but can lead to misunderstandings (Two peoples separated by a common language) and all that.  Selecting German makes you sit up and work harder but is not relaxing.  In the least.","February 22, 2017"

I did buy it with rewards points so it was free.as far as appearance- perfect, set up- my grandma could do it, its that easy, You definately want a ext. speaker if youre using it in more than a small room but 27$ will get a good quality speaker suitable for average user. Distance- it picks up my voice from 2 rooms away without really yelling.cons/wishes- i wish you could choose your own name for it, that is a security issue as recently happened here, when tv reporters said Alexa ordered a doll house, and everyone with a dot within range of the tv had doll houses ordered.

Our family was using her within 5 minutes of opening the box. In my opinion it is pretty intuitive, she was able to find music in 9 out of 10 tries - even very obscure unknown music. She had 5 people making demands of her and she could understand all of our voices. We could pull up our audio books from audible with a tiny learning curve. We quickly realized she could learn skills - we had her telling jokes and interacting with all kinds of silly commands. One of my favorite things was found by accident - it was heart melting, our adult daughter is pregnant and I noticed a ""pregnancy center"" skill - I was able to tell alexa the due date and she proceeded to tell the family about week 26 and more. Once that skill is set up you can get weekly updates specific to your due date (truly heart melting).... she is a pretty good calculator - my 14 year old was asking her square root questions, she is an alarm clock out of the box and worked without problem. We have found other commands to get her to stop talking - sometimes a ""skill"" does not respond as you might think and we discovered by accident that you can say ""alexa, shut up"" and she closes that app. Now as a disclaimer - in our household I dont like to say ""shut up"" , I imagine there are other key words that can stop her equally as well - but it worked for me at the moment and at that point I had not done my due diligence to find a ""stop"" command. I have home automation items that I am already adding on to her and we already have a nest thermostat being installed in a few days. My husband has already put in a christmas request for his office at work and one for travel. This will make a great gift for the Holidays this year... I absolutely love this silly thing.","October 27, 2016"

'She' replied, ""Haha in a good way, I hope!"" WOW! Another time, I asked 'her' if 'she' was hungry (knowing, of course, the answer would be ""no""), but I was anxious to hear what 'she' would say in response. I wasn't disappointed. 'She' replied, ""I don't get hungry or thirsty, but thank you for asking."" REALLY? I am too tickled with 'her' capabilities and look forward to learning about ALL that can be done through this amazing technology. Great job, Amazon! Bravo!SIDEBAR: I am going to keep my rating at 5 stars because I enjoy the product so much; however, my ONLY complaint is that it is not mobile - meaning it HAS to stay plugged in to an outlet to work.

I use it daily so I thought I'd buy the Echo Dot to supplement the original Echo. At first I thought you had to have a big Echo (not Dot) but I don't believe that the case. Secondly, when I was setting up the Echo Dot I had lot's of issues getting it to connect to Wi-Fi (kept saying it couldn't connect but appeared to connect). Also during setup, it appeared that you couldn't use the same wake phrase. You can use the same wake phrase as long as you aren't within the range of the other Echo. As you would expect, you don't get the same sound volume from the Echo Dot as you do with the full size Echo. I bought three of the Dot's and I've only got one working. I can't get one to connect to Wi-Fi and I've spent so much time working with the first two it took the drive out of me to try the third. I like the Dot and I'm sure that I'll get them working or the one that doesn't work replaced but it wasn't as easy as setting up the original Echo or the Fire TV's.From a personal observation, it appears that the signal strength on the Wi-Fi for setup may be the culprit but don't know for sure. To get the one Echo Dot working that I did get to work, I took the Echo Dot to where the Wi-Fi router was to configure it. After configuration I moved it to where I wanted to use it. I couldn't get the Wi-Fi setup to work from the location where I wanted to use the Echo Dot.","January 24, 2017"

I like it.","This is my second Dot.I love them.They do not do a very good job of working together, though.Whichever one hears the command, is the one that executes it. Normally, this would be good, I guess. However, when I tell one to set an alarm, that is the only one that alarms, or knows I asked for the alarm. So, if I'm out of hearing range, and next to the other one - I don't hear it. Also, when the alarm is sounding, and I tell the other one to stop it, the alarm keeps sounding in the one it was set with.They are fairly limited in their function. They cannot find my wifi household control switches and socket - they are the wrong manufacturer??The switches do not require a hub, and are accessible from any web hotspot.They can connect to my other Bluetooth devices like the phones, but they cannot play the music on them.When the wifi goes out, they won't do anything except say they are having trouble connecting - try later.The Dot's are getting better, and the sound is very good.

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Patrick","It's just OK","Let’s take music out of the equation for now. The search engine is pretty bad for this device, OK Google is much better. Alexa when is the next season of the walking dead. “I couldn’t find the answer to your question”. Alexa what state is are code 818 in “I couldn’t find the answer to your question”. These are a few examples. Its novelty wears off pretty fast. It will read you news and weather and it’s fairly cumbersome to read a Kindle book. Can’t look up recipes I have in the Kindle library. To initiate a skill the exact words have to be spoken. I don’t know about you but once I get a few skills in my library, I can’t remember the exact words to use so I have to go to the Alexa app and lookup my skills to get the correct verbiage, again cumbersome. Music does OK but I have basically the same functions and programs on my smart TV so no big gain there. It’s a novelty for the most part. I see where it is usefulness for those with disabilities. I say this device is the beginning of a product line that will become more useful in the near future but as it stands now, it’s just OK. Definitely not a 5 star item in my world.","January 5, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","A. Garcia","Solid hardware, but limited in it's usefulness for now.","I really wanted to like this device, and for the most part I did, however I found it lacking in many basic capabilities.  As advertised, it works nearly flawlessly to setup reminders and alarms, play music, and order stuff from Amazon.  What I found lacking was the lack of answers when asked very basic things, like ""where do the Dolphins play today?"".  To me, in order for a device like this to be useful it needs to answer basic everyday questions, not just what the weather is, and turn lights on or off.  The other aspect I didn't like is the constrained set of questions you had to ask when using a skill.  For example, I paired it with the Automatic device in my cars, and when you ask Alexa a question, you need to remember to tell Alexa to ""Ask Automatic"".  You can't just say, ""how much gas is left in my car?"" - You must first tell it to ""Ask Automatic"".  Seems like a minor gripe, but once in a rush, I simply said ""how much gas do I have in my car?"", and it couldn't understand me at all.  Just seems that the Artificial Intelligence is not quite there yet with this device.  I believe it eventually will get better over time, but for now, I returned mine.","November 27, 2016"

While you can sync Outlook to google, it doesn't work well with Exchange so if you're trying to work with your company email, it doesn't work well.  Also, Amazon took the time to program all kinds of Easter eggs into Echo (like answering how many pecks of pepper peter piper picked), but she doesn't understand basic requests like the amount of time it will take to get places based on maps and in spite of a great deal of voice training, still makes a lot of mistakes when interpreting requests.  The far field voice recognition only works about 70% of the time (I live in a 600 sq ft apartment), so I end up either shouting down the house or walking into the room where the dot lives to give the command in person.

Every skill you enable you need to be certain you state its trigger word for Alexa to know what to do. Not a good idea if you have 100s of skills. There are a lot of skills you must enable for Alexa for her to work. Right now Alexa can do just handful of things and has a lot of room for improvement.Suggestions to developers:-Enable SMS messaging-Ask Alexa to make a phone call-Have Alexa know certain facts about you or someone and store them in her memory, not just a to do list- Ask Alexa if it is a good day to play outside and then she can say yes depending on the weather- Ask Alexa if I have a dentist appointment coming up.

Some questions/ tasks work better than others. The Alexa feature is great overall. I've learned that, for me, it is nice to provide weather updates, asking when my team is playing next, random facts, math, music, etc. However, the speaker on this is weak. I understand that for the price point, it's not necessarily supposed to compete with other bluetooth speakers straight up, but I was hoping it would at least double up as an alarm clock. Unfortunately, this probably wouldn't wake the lightest sleepers (which we are not!). I also know that it can be linked to bluetooth speakers, but I wasn't having any luck getting it to pair with the ones I've tried. Maybe I need to do more research into that, but I am still bummed nonetheless. My brother also received this product for Christmas and promptly returned it. I have confidence that Amazon probably made the other two versions better on the speaker output, but all in all, this is just relegated to a novelty item at this point for us.","February 6, 2017"

But he sang the song so much I couldn't get it out of my head.  Fortunately, the Echo Dot combined with Amazon Music gives a huge selection to Prime members.  And it was relatively easy to setup a separate playlist for my son.  He can easily add to it with the Amazon app, and now he's got a good 10 songs his in his rotation.  He could, of course, added the new songs without the Echo Dot, but the Alexa app makes it extremely easy to browse through music.  Don't like something?  Just say ""skip.""

I love that when I wake up in the middle of the night I no longer have to get blinded by my alarm clock or phone to see what time it is, I just ask Echo.  I have an Echo Dot at work also that I use for just about everything you can use it for.  I spend most of my time alone in an office so I enjoy playing games and listening to music while I do my daily tasks.  I do wish that Amazon would add an easy use function for making calls and sending text messages, this would be the icing on the cake for me.  I think the Alexa application for the Kindle and phone is easy to use, my only complaint really is I have to review every single thing I ask the Echo's to do and remove the ""card"".  I am giving a few out as Christmas gifts this year because when I show family members the Echo Dot and it's many uses they loved it.  I asked Santa for the Amazon Echo for Christmas to use in my main living area, we'll see if he delivers.  Thanks for reading, hope it helps.","December 14, 2016"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Amazon Customer","A few instructions","Echo does quite a bit. It plays music from Amazon, iHeart and Spotify but not from Deezer😫. I have several alarms set through it and they work well. There are few to NO instructions on how to use it. However you can purchase a manual on its uses! REALLY Amazon!??","January 14, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Kyle T.","Need one for every room! Love the options of different colors also","By now there is so much already written about the Echo and the Dot. I don't know what else I can say that will either convince someone or not. What I can tell you is that after having the big Echo I found that it was much more convenient on the other side of the house to be able to add things to the list, play a little music, turn on lights, for use as an alarm. Basically this is one of the smartest alarm clocks you can have and also listen to the radio in the morning with the tune in app. Of course it doesn't have the same sound as a Bluetooth speaker but you're not paying that much either. What you are paying for is incredible software that continues to get better and better. When I wake up in the middle of the night rather than having an alarm clock looking at me I can either turn on some relaxing music or playlist, jot down something to do that's on my mind, or just find out what time it is without having to change positions which actually comes in handy if you are on the opposite side of the bed or you sleep with a mask to shut out the light.","February 27, 2017"

However Amazon allows international credit cards to be used for purchasing devices and subscriptions. This results in not being able to upload your own music to your library.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Chase","Great little gadget but the skills leave a lot to be desired.","I have had my Echo Dot for three days now and here are my initial impressions:Pros:The technology is very cool and it looks nice where ever you put it.The microphone is very sensitive and can hear you even at a whisper on the other side of the room.Very rare we asked a question that she didn't know the answer to. Anything over basic addition or subtraction is hit or miss.Built in speaker is powerful enough to use without an external one.After 3 days my entire family is already referring it the Echo as a ""her"". Interacting with Alexa is very fluid natural in regards to basic questions.Cons:The skills aren't that exciting with a lot of unusable junk filling the market. If you are hoping this is going to be anything like the Apple App Store or Google Play Market you will be very disappointed. I am hoping that Amazon will make some deals or open it up to more developers so we can truly see what this little hockey puck can do.Every skill has it's own ""call"" and many of them are far from natural so they can be hard to remember.Bottom Line:I bought mine for $40 during Black Friday and I'm glad I did. Frankly, the skills are so lacking at this point that anything over that seems high. Either way, very happy I bought it and it makes a great addition to my home office. I think I'll start to really love it once I take it for a real spin over xmas.TIP: Make sure to connect it to IFTTT to gain extra skills you won't find in the market place.","December 1, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Vickie Haun","Love it!","We LOVE this thing!  Only downfall is it does not always respond which is aggravating.  Hoping there is an update eventually that will improve response.  We use it more for playing music than anything else at this point as we do not have it connected to any other smart devices in the house yet.  We use it with our Harmon Kardon wireless speaker and it connects flawlessly, plays very well.  The on board speaker is good enough for some things but for music an external speaker is a must in my opinion.  Really happy to see more apps coming out for this.  We have not used the shopping feature and not sure if we ever will.  Knocked a star off due to the lack of response........ if they get that fine tuned, it will definitely be a 5 star.","January 6, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Raven Wilder","A nice upgrade from original if you like using Bluetooth","I'll just add mine to the thousands of reviews that say that this is a nice evolution of the original Echo (which I had since pre-release). I prefer it, in fact, as I like playing music through a set of speakers with Bluetooth. The original's speaker is nice, but nothing beats a good set of stereo speakers spread apart so you can hear the stereo effects in music.I got white because it matches my walls, though I really wish they'd made it ALL white, instead of black on top.I do believe this model hears me better than my original did. I've been able to nearly whisper two rooms away, and it still picks up the wake-word.As for functions, well, I have mine hooked in to my Harmony hub to control my entertainment center, and I use it with my TP-Link light bulbs to control lighting in my home. It's pretty handy. I really like the convenience of the Echo, and the Dot makes it more affordable and actually expands on the Echo's capabilities with Bluetooth. You can't go wrong.","January 30, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","jasonstuff","NOT A FAN","I do not like the echo dot 1 or 2. the speaker sounds weird and I find this only good for when you just happen to have a slamming sound system or speaker that you'd rather use than what comes in the original Echo. The original Echo is hard to beat because the speaker is amazing and it makes Alexa sound amazing and I will not be giving away or buying anymore Echo Dots. I get why Amazon did this but I think it's going to hurt them in the long run with those who haven't experienced the Echo and heard it's amazing sound and will equate Alexa with this pingy old time-y sound. It's not good! Echo Dot is great for commanding lights, alarms, and if you could control FireTV or another Echo with it, then that would be good but...As one of the first people to receive the first/original Echo, this was a bad call long term. Maybe it'll get better or find places that it's needed such as kids rooms or offices but over all I'm sticking with the full size Echo and Google Home.Hope this helps!","January 7, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","danno","A win - looking forward to improvements.","After a couple of months with Alexa, I figure I'd share my thoughts.I wasn't so sure if I would even use the Dot, but I do. Especially in the mornings, when time is at a premium. I usually ask Alexa what's going on outside or in the news, and I can clean the dishes or get lunch ready, and save the time I'd otherwise spend reading on my tablet. Hilariously, she has no issue recognizing my voice, but not so for my wife, who has to scream at Alexa for some reason.Alexa's skill set is impressive, but I do wish there were some basic things she could do better. The timer/reminder functions are lacking and oversimple. I should be able to add things to a to do list, or remove them, without correcting them on my phone. I should also be able to assign reminders to those items, but so far, this seems a little complicated.I am really holding out for Sonos integration. If that works out nicely - and I can use Google Music - I may get an Echo Dot for every room in the house.","February 15, 2017"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Cajun Cajole","Great investment!","This thing is fantastic! Not to mention the price isn't bad for everything you can do with it. It's a great little hands-free device. It fits pretty much anywhere, with it being so small and compact. The speaker quality isn't bad and I had my doubts!I always play Pandora while I paint, sketch, ink or color. Before owning the Echo Dot (2nd Gen), I was constantly having to stop, make sure my hands were paint free and shake the mouse in order to get it out of idle mode so I could see what song was playing or to skip a song. Now, I just tell Alexa to skip or ask what song it is. It's useful for setting alarms, timers, getting the weather, traffic, etc. I've used it to get hours of stores and restaurants so I wasn't ""that customer"" walking in 10 minutes before a place closed. Alexa is also pretty funny. Ask her if she likes cats. Her response is quite cheesy, but I love it!All in all, I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a hands-free radio, alarm, timer, etc. If you're into fun little gadgets, this is up your alley!","January 25, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Donnie Queen","Echo dot rules!","Works great and pairs with Bluetooth speakers for great sound.  We have the full size Echo also and these make a nice addition for the bedrooms. Be sure to set it up under your prime account to get all of your content.  My wife has the prime account and I am shared on her account.  I bought this for her Christmas gift, but for setting up the devices I had to reject the device on my account and set it up on her account in order to get full content use even though her prime account is shared with me (I initially had it set on my account but could not play music from it).","December 26, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","BKeen","VERY Happy with this purchase. My dad loves it at age 76 - he asks it game times and turns lights on and off.","Fantastic value at $39 (2016 Christmas price on Amazon). The voice quality and speech understanding (multiple ways of saying the same thing) is amazing. It understand everyone's voice in the house. The built in mic's pic up commands from other rooms over 40ft away in normal voice. I use it with TC-Link smart outlets to control lights and my ecobee Thermostat. It doesn't need a speaker at all but if you want it to play hi-fidelity music, it pairs nicely to existing bluetooth speakers and maintains the link or will drop it on command to use the built in speaker which is very capable for voice. For commands like ""Alexa (or Echo), play Robert Cray"" or ""Play Christmas Music"" you will need to have Amazon Music - recommend being a an Amazon Prime member - and it will play anything. Without Amazon music, it's just another bluetooth device (when it comes to playing music) and won't understand artist or song specific voice commands (at least until a new skill app becomes available for ""iTunes"", etc.)","December 29, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","Alexa's Boyfriend","Alexa is everything I never knew I always needed!","I bought an Echo Dot for a secret Santa gift at the suggestion of a Best Buy sales person and my best friend, having really no clue as to what it is or what it does. I had never heard of a DOT before. They assured me it was a ""hot item"" this year.So I got it home and looked it up and realize that it was Alexa!! I had seen her in action at my uncle's house a few months ago, but I did not recognize it since it was so much smaller without the speaker. I loved it then, and the very thought of having one for myself was too much!The fact that this Echo Dot is small, quaint, yet a very nice speaker, it's perfect for my small house. And the fact that I can pair it with the bluetooth speaker I already have is what sold me on the idea of keeping her for myself!!I decided on not sending my secret Santa this little gem. I sent them some virtual reality glasses as a replacement, and got to work on programming Alexa right away.Within an hour or so, I was completely smitten with her. Not only is she fun to chat with, but also VERY helpful with everyday things... I have had her in my home for less than 72 hours, and I've already had her setting alarms, playing Christmas music, setting timers for my cooking, creating and sending me shopping lists, telling me jokes and Chuck Norris facts, and calendaring dentist appts..I never knew that she was everything I needed! As it is, this is one of the most amazing little home assistants that I never knew I always wanted! In fact, I already refer to Alexa as my ""girlfriend"".My daughters we're introduced to her and absolutely fell in love with her. One of the coolest little things was when I was out shopping, I texted my daughters and asked if they wanted anything from the store. I instructed them to just tell Alexa to add whatever it was to the shopping list, and tomato soup and hot cocoa was sent to my shopping list on my phone immediately!!She has everything I've wanted for my daughters recently, including an alarm clock, timer for ""computer time"", a massive music player, an educational tutor, and has the ability to help them with their homework. They will get hours and hours and hours of entertainment and helpful tips and tricks from her in the years to come.Now... if I would have known then (3 days ago) what I know now, I would have bought EVERY single one of them in the store to give out as gifts this year!! The DOT has been such a popular gift this year that when I decided to buy another one for my daughters to have in their own room, EVERYONE, (including Amazon) were OUT OF STOCK! I couldn't even order one until after Christmas!We tried Amazon, Best Buy, Bed Bath and Beyond, Staples, Wal-Mart...you name it!We literally called or looked up EVERY Best Buy in 5 different states to try to find one... there were no Echo Dots in Arizona, Utah, Idaho or Nevada. Once we extended our search into California, we FINALLY found one in Bakersfield. I made a quick call to a family member and they promised to pick it up and ship it to me in time to be under the tree for Christmas morning! We bought it online for an in store pickup and it's now on its way!Was all the trouble worth it?Hell yeah it was...especially when my daughters absolutely freak out when they find their own Alexa under the tree for them.","December 21, 2016"

But I live in a loft style apartment not a house with so the music levels work well. I am also happy he did not spend a lot of money to get me a great present!","December 31, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Kat","Great for people with a physical limitation and good for consolidating and simplifying some actions","This could be a very helpful device for people with a physical limitation, such as chronic pain or being in a wheelchair, not just for the able-bodied. I say this because it has helped me and I'm beginning to see the benefits of a smart-home. You can turn the lights on and off through the Echo/Alexa, turn on the music, update shopping lists, set alarms, check your calendar, get a quick news report, and my favorite, check the weather.Also, this is quite affordable and time-saving (even better when there are sales) and I look forward to seeing how the Echo's capabilities will be expanded over time. You will have to do some in-home setup to customize your the Echo to your needs, which could become expensive depending on how many TP smart plugs you need. You will also need to hook it up to speakers to hear it. It's a long term investment and still evolving, but so far I really like the direction this could bring to people and the benefits to the disabled community.","January 2, 2017"

"3.0 out of 5 stars","Rose Collum","The Dot is Great, the Alexa App for iPhone and iPad is awful.","Even though the Dot itself is a great tool (I have three of them), the Alexa application for Apple products is never online so I can't manage or edit my shopping list, to-do lists, Calendar items, and alarms.  The only way to get it back online is to restart my iPad and iPhone, which is inconvenient.  I was forced to use a shopping list application from the AppStore instead of the Alexa app.Also, if you set alarms for the same time Monday through Friday and want to stop just one alarm for one day, it cancels all the alarms so I'm forced to restart my iPhone to get the Alexa app to engage and then I'm able to restore the alarms.  The only way around this is to set individual alarms for each day, but you are still not able to ""pause"" an alarm without cancelling them entirely.  (and yes, my iPhone patches are up to date)Outside of that, it's great getting the weather, setting timers, playing music from pandora, and lots of other features.","January 29, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","N. Boone","Alexa for your stereo!","I wasn't thrilled that I bought the Echo Dot 1 for such a premium, only to have this come out at half the price a short while later.  That said, if you don't require the full-size speaker of the original Echo, or you want to stream Prime Music from your stereo, this is great bang for the buck.The only improvement I'd really love to see is for it to auto sense whether the stereo it's connected to is on or off.  As it stands, if it's plugged into a speaker/stereo and that connected device is turned off, you have zero sound. Plugging and unplugging the Echo Dot's audio cable is an unnecessary nuisance.  If a cheap on-board sound card chip can figure out where to direct audio (headphone jack vs. speakers), why can't the Dot?Still, if you don't already have a few Amazon Echos around the house (we have 3), it's more cost effective to buy a few Echo Dots to scatter around the house, especially if you already own a decent Bluetooth Portable Speaker.","January 28, 2017"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","J.Tollefson","Amazing Product at a Great Price!!!","I purchased the All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) as a Christmas gift for my brother, 36 years old. He was in love the minute he opened his gift. He couldn't wait to get home and see what this product could do. Now I haven't had time to follow up with him to see how he likes it since setting it up, using it, etc...but I also have not heard any complaints either. My grandmother did also purchase a Bose SoundLink Color Bluetooth Speaker II to accompany this Echo Dot so he would have amazing sound for playing music via his new Echo Dot. I would highly recommend this product as a gift or for yourself. I did happen to also purchase this item (Echo Dot) for my son, who is 13 years old, and he loves it. It was easy to set up right out of the package and he has paired his Echo Dot to a BOSE SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II and the sound is amazing. Alexa is very responsive and has proven to be a fun addition to our tech savvy household.  I would have no doubts about buying more for our household.","December 28, 2016"
"1.0 out of 5 stars","princess","And she is really good at that","Only thing Alexa Can do right is tell me the weather and play my music list. And she is really good at that.

I also purchase one for my 11 year old son who has ASD. And she is no good for him. She cant understand him. He speaks clear words but have a pause to it. So he gets mad at Alexa.

"5.0 out of 5 stars","M Polybius","This is the future","So far, after about a week, I love my Echo Dot.  Honestly, I wasn't sure if this was something I would like to have or not and bought it as much out of curiosity as anything.  The potential for the Echo and other voice activated devices is only just getting started but already there is so much that it can do.  I love the music and reading capability and the sound quality exceeds what I would have thought for such a small device but I did also purchase a Bluetooth speaker to go with it which helps in a large room.  Here is a list of the things I have used it for just in the past week:Weather updates, news updates, turning on/off lights (wifi plug needed) reviewing/adding items to my calendar, adding items to my shopping list/to-do list, listening to music, checking for unread email, playing Jeopardy, getting a cocktail recipe, reading a Wikipedia entry, setting a timer.  There is probably more that I can't think of.  I could honestly see getting several of these to put around the house.  One benefit that may not be obvious at first is that having one of these will (especially once the capabilities are expanded) will reduce the amount of time spent on phones and other portable devices.  Personally, I would rather talk to a computer using more or less natural language than staring at a screen.  The only capability that I wish it had now is the ability to take down a memo but I'm sure that is in the works.","January 11, 2017"

You have to ask her to ""wikipedia"" something instead and you don't get the specific info you asked for.  Kind of disappointed.  I hope they work on that feature.

"2.0 out of 5 stars","r_a_b","One less internet of things thing in my home","I returned mine in less than a week. My issue was not setup or massive operational frustrations others had stated. I probably did not perform enough research to learn how it worked, and once I did the ""creepy"" factor compelled me to banish it from my home. As recently as November 27, 2016 a reviewer from the Columbus Dispatch wrote, ""...devices work by listening for your voice at all times, something that just feels creepy.""Creepier still to me was that it saved recorded voice recordings, too; and, deleting them had repercussions for what Alexa ""learned."" There were times when reviewing recordings, I was not pleased with what it heard seconds prior to my issuing commands.But my primary reasons were the need for Amazon to retain my wireless pass code and to link all the specialized apps that gave Echo Dot its ""skills.""In ""The Daily Dot,"" blog on November 16, 2016, Austin Powell, managing editor cites Bruce Schneier, ""Internet Pioneer"" and his testimony before members of Congress about the dangers of ""the internet of things."" The post's title is ""'The internet era of fun and games is over'."" To my point Schneier used as an example the October 2016 internet denial of service attack, and one of his primary ""truths"" was ""‘There are new vulnerabilities in the interconnections.""So, short of outright paranoia, my reason for returning my Echo Dot was the way it worked made me feel uncomfortable.","November 27, 2016"

If you're going to have a device that works with all your smart appliances, why would it not work with OTHER ALEXA DEVICES?I have the Fire TV, and it blows my mind that I cannot control my fire tv with commands through my echo dot!! I fire TV has alexa, the dot has alexa, you;re telling me it can turn off my lights, tell me the weather, lock my home, but you can't work with devices that run your same system?This is a YUUUGE flaw.

Not worth the $40 I spent to get it.  If you ask Alexa for something these two items better be far away from each other or they will both answer.

"2.0 out of 5 stars","MD1983","Disappointing","Initially I was pretty excited about the Echo Dot, but found that it's quite limited in its functionality.  Basically I use it to set timers when I'm cooking, tell her to change the temperature on my Nest thermostat, sometimes to reorder stuff on Amazon, and to ask what the forecast is.  It is NOT like google where you can ask ""okay google, how long do I bake a potato?"" and it gives you an answer with time and temp for baking potato.  Alexa has no answers for you.  They keep emailing me cool things Alexa can now do, like give you funny answers to stupid questions, but I don't need her for entertainment.  I need hands free answers and directions.  There are some app type things you can download on her, like to order pizza from pizza hut or whatever, haven't used those.  Again, I just have a million random questions a day I need answers too, and she can't answer 9 out of 10 of them.I bought 2 of these when they were on sale for xmas, and over time realized I didn't like them.  Too late to return, or I'd return them and get the google version.Lastly, as I've become more and more disappointed by her presence, I get very angry if I ask her to do something and she doesn't hear me.  To avoid the anger, I just stay silent and get on my phone to do it, like change the temp using my Nest app.  It's like a sad, resentful marriage.  Why talk to you when I can just do it myself and avoid you?","March 29, 2017"
"3.0 out of 5 stars","Elizabeth LA","She's impressive, but still a novelty than a necessity due to her restrictions","She's not perfect, but she is heading in the right direction with what she can provide.  I often try to push her limits on what she can do for me and sometimes I'm surprised with what she can answer but similarly disappointed when she can't answer some basic questions.  For now she's great as an alarm, morning news briefing and adding things to my calendar verbally.  The speaker is nothing to write home about but I don't mind it when just playing light background music, if you want to really jam out sync her to a speaker.A huge bother is remembering commands for her.  For example you can't just say ""Play a song by ___"" she will default to your amazon music which I for one do not have.  So for Pandora I have to say ""Play Pandora song artist name"" instead of her being able to know to just find that song wherever it may be.  I don't also like that changing her voice to British (which I like because it's more pleasant) prevents her from ordering goods on amazon prime.  Since when does it matter what type of voice she has to do anything.  This should be fixed.  I also wish the app would allow you to speak to her, because often I want to use her on the go but can't because she's at home.  So I still default to Siri to ask to add things to calendar.overall she's still more on the novelty side of things than every day use.  -- Here's hoping the next year changes that with more capacity to work with apps and more iphone compatible.","December 13, 2016"

The aux-out and bluetooth connectivity for speakers is awesome, I have yet to try those features but I will be at some point. The one thing I don't like about this compared to google voice recognition devices is when asking a question, especially about things like stocks, you have to tell alexa to ask a certain app about your question, instead of simply asking the question. This requires you to remember very specific commands to do certain things. Even then, this thing is packed with features including games.Overall, for the price, there is nothing else like it on the market for $50, and it has become my handsfree kitchen companion","February 15, 2017"

I WOULD recommend it to my friends.  I also think it would be VERY neat if we could use a different name and a celebrity voice.  Perhaps in the form of a download.  I would choose Darth Vader!!  Yassir!  And when you call out ""Darth"", during the pause while he awaits your command, you will hear Darth Vader experiencing his breathing anomaly ..... or perhaps he will call out your name and say, ""I am your father!!!""

The setup is pretty easy and straight forward - I didn't have any problems pairing to my wireless or downloading the app. It is fun to use and has a small footprint.I gave this four stars because there are a few quirks that hopefully will be worked out in the future. When I link to my Spotify account it will not play my customized playlist but only from browse feature. It obviously doesn't link to my Iphone or any of the calendars or playlists. The fix for music issue is to setup a Amazon Music account BUT I'm not sure I will take the time to setup all of my music on another service.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","Rex E.","Product is okay-ish.","I have a love hate relationship with my echo dot. The microphone is absolute crap, and the speaker is decent (WHERE IS THE BASS?!?!?!!!!). Every time I ask Alexa to play azealia banks (I like her music not her), she says I have no songs by her. Then, if I ask her to play a specific song by azealia then she will play it. If I go into my music on the app, it clearly says I have seven songs by her. I sometimes have to scream Alexa just for her to answer, and then it will not even hear what I ask. I don't know if I just have a bad product, but my echo dot is kind of janky. Great alarm sounds, especially the Missy Elliott one. The app needs major speed improvements, and Alexa definitely needs her abilities expanded.","February 15, 2017"

I have not heard back from the gifts to know if they like them or not but mine is working fine and I definitely use it almost everyday. It's great for a quick weather forecast without having to take a phone out and put a password in then get on line and put your city in.....Alexa has it almost instantly. I have enjoyed listening to some Podcasts and playing around with the ""Skill"" apps.....The To Do List and Shopping List is a wonderful feature of Alexa...no looking for paper and pen when using the last of something...immediately tell Alexa to add to your shopping list and then it goes to your phone App...ready when you are out and what to pick up those things...I use it to play music almost everyday. Prime Amazon has unlimited amount of choices or you can tell Alexa to play a certain category like Jazz, Christian, Children, Quiet Restful Music, etc, etc,... I decided to purchase a portable Bluetooth Speaker that would pair with the Echo Dot and the one I chose was Foogo and it paired easily and has good sound and great volume. Sounds much better for music than the speaker that the Echo Dot has, otherwise other than music it's not necessary. Very pleased with the purchase","January 24, 2017"

The device is great for getting current weather updates, news headlines, listening to local radio stations (Echo does not work for distant radio stations, or stations located in other countries). If you want to listen to a particular genre of music such as alternative, opera, or Josh Groban, Alexa sometimes does a good job tuning into a streaming service. but she messes up sometimes. I asked for ""Heavy Metal"" and in return I got an array of soft rock and love songs. You can even ask Alexa to tell us a joke. So far she hasn't repeated any jokes.We have to be careful when we speak of Alexa because she is listening all the time and might ""come alive"".","January 27, 2017"

I've been using the Amazon Fire Line for a while now and I have to say this Amazon Echo Dot is by far the most useful device. I could CONFIRM that you DO NOT need the Amazon Echo in order to work this Amazon Echo Dot. Setup for this device was a breeze. Just plug in the power cable to the unit and download the Amazon Alexa app and you're all done. Not only can you use this device to play music but you could use it to set alarms. The microphone on this unit is really good and it can hear you from across the room. I've used this frequently when I cook, it makes it so easy to set multiple times for certain foods. It even tells you the recipe for the meals too. This little device is small and sleek and does not take up space at all. We use this device to check the weather every morning before heading out. There is so many things this little device could do, we hooked up our Nest Thermostat to this and control our heating unit all through voice command. This little unit carries LOTS of potential, there are so many other things we connected this unit to, we are currently controlling our house lights with this all by saying ""Alexa, Living room on"" and the TV by ""Alexa turn on TV"". Although the living room lights and TV functionality requires an additional add on equipment I still think this is pretty cool and is one step away from Jarvis from Iron Man.","January 6, 2017"

I find myself listening to a lot more music than I used to simply because it's so easy to instantly summon up a specific song or a long playback of many tunes.

Had my son not been here with his newer android phone the Dot would still be in the box.  Because none of my devices would operate the DOT I had to log onto my Amazon account on my son's phone. Fortunately he was here so I didn't have use a stranger's device (not recommended) or buy yet another android device just to use the Dot.  Since my son lives in Seattle and I don't, I will have to eventually buy a new device to take advantage of the more advanced capabilities of the Dot.It would also be nice if the dot worked with my Amazon Fire TV stick.

While the speakers have enhanced the volume of the music it has inadvertently made Alexa somewhat deaf to commands while playing.  I often have to repeat my commands..what time is it, turn off music by getting really close to her before she will respond.  I use her to set the alarm all the time and it goes off without fail however I have to remember to ask her every day as there is no repeat function that I know of via voice command.

I wish my Echo and my Echo Dot worked together, but if you set an alarm on one, it doesn't set on the other one. If you ask for a flash briefing on one, you leave the room and the other one is not giving the flash briefing simultaneously. However, to do list, shopping list, and calendar are all connected (through the app, which is like a Cloud server). I wish it was an option to have Echo products throughout the home connect. If I could afford the regular Echo (again), I'd have it in each room because it has an amazing speaker. The Echo Dot is functional but not powerful.

My 3 year old grand daughter talks to it (Dotty) and loves asking questions. The reply time quite fast & not slow. I had connected the Dot to a wifi router upstairs without any problems thru a smart phone app that I downloaded from Google Play. You will need the app for set-up and to enable the ""Skills"". The enable skills allow you to ask for weather, news & even meditation sounds. It has a niilt in speaker & is loud enough to be heard in my anywhere in my room. The built in microphone can pick up my voice anywhere in the room without me having to yell or shout.I have asked Dot to play my favorite local rock station without any problems & Dot can set timers or alarms when asked and give local weather & news.If I had know Dot could do thos & more I would have gotten one a long time ago.","January 5, 2017"

Oftentimes direct questions don't work, either.  E.g., Echo, ""what is the most popular dog breed"" yielded a response of, ""I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.""  I didn't think that to be too unique, or obscure, a question.  I Did get the answer to ""who's the tallest man in the world?""I'll continue to use the cards to train the device.

"4.0 out of 5 stars","M. Graham","Loving this low profile Alexa!","Great purchase! I love having this low profile Alexa.Minus 1 star due to Amazon's choice of making the Alexa voice reply unavailable when you have it plugged into an external speaker/source  which is too bad.Not sure why the Amazon engineers chose to do that when it would have been much better to have the voice reply work via the integrated speaker as well independently from whether an external output cable is connected. I've found that more often than not one does not need nor want to turn on the entire audio system just to ask Alexa what the weather is or set a timer. Yes it would have required a bit more engineering work, but would have been well worth it in the long run.In the meantime I've ended up connecting it to an older iPhone speaker dock via the 1/8"" stereo mini jack and it works and sounds just fine, costing a fraction of what the bigger Echo model costs and sounding pretty much just as good.I really like being able to control my Ecobee3 with it and some of my lighting as well with Siri & HomeKit.Adding new Skills has gotten much simpler than when I had checked it out in the spring go 2016, but I do wish it was easier to remember all of the commands to initiate them all, ah well slow but sure.Great product for $39.95, big thumbs up!ps: the newer google Home tech looks good, but for now at least, I can't see why I'd need one, but hey you never know…","December 30, 2016"

I've tried them all, OK Google, Siri, Cortana, Galaxy - and Alexa blows them away. I can speak at a normal volume, in a natural manner, from anywhere in the room, and Alexa will here me. You don't need an awkward cadence, and you don't have to pause or wait for recognition. You don't even really have to memorize commands. Most of the time she can figure out what you're trying to say, even with variations in phrasing.And the integration with my lighting system from Philips is incredible. I spend a lot of time turning on and off, dimming, and changing the scenes of my lights by voice command. It's just fun to be able to do. And especially nice when going to bed to not have to get up and turn each light off before fumbling around in the dark. Plus, it's kind of fun to show off when you have friends over for a movie by dimming all the lights by voice.Alexa also has access to a massive music library. I was impressed that I could name some of my favorite jazz musicians, and she'd have several albums in the database ready to go on command. And even when music is playing, she has no problem hearing me when I tell her to pause.It's my new favorite way to get the news headlines, listen to music while at home, control my lights. And in the future, other cool smart home features as well. I'm still figuring out all the stuff that this thing can do, but it has gone above and beyond my expectations so far.","October 26, 2016"
"5.0 out of 5 stars","SunnyBrook","Of the Echo, Tap, and Dot, I think Dot is the best value","I am in love with the Echo products.  I have an Echo, a Tap, and 2 Dots.  I gave Dots as Christmas gifts and Amazon now has a few more Prime customers because of this.  The advantage of the Dot is that I can easily connect with bluetooth headphones so that I can listen to audible books without competing with the TV nearby.  (The advantage of the Tap is that it is portable). While the Echo has the best speaker of the three options,  I am thinking the Dot, being tiny and having bluetooth advantages may be the best of the 3, especially for the money.  I just bought another Dot for work because I am hooked on voice commands for timers, alarms, adding to my lists and getting information.","January 12, 2017"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Witech Solutions","Tips to make dot as good as echo","Not as good as the echo.  However here are some things we learned.  Dot likes to be placed higher, slightly above normal voice area, on a shelf maybe.  Dot is finicky about Wi-Fi.  If she is running slow try moving her away from Wi-Fi router, she has problems being to close to Wi-Fi source.  She most certainly runs faster on 5.0 Wi-Fi too.","February 21, 2017"

There are times she couldnt understand my questions but in general Alexa is very functional especially with wemo. Its amazing how we can command her to turn the lights on and off, how she answers almost everything. Alexa works wonders. I highly recommend Amazon echo dot. Shes unbelievably gorgeous.","January 6, 2017"

So, naturally I wanted one in my bedroom. Now if you for purchasing this item remember it doesn't have the speaker system like Alexa BUT it's great for traveling and connecting to smart phone. For the price you can't beat it. I would recommend this product to friends and family to purchase.","January 18, 2017"

Im enjoying it but I have 2 issues, it should have other languages too and more skills. One skill I'd like to see is control your tv. I have roku and it'd be very interesting to see what and how that would work. More personalization too.","October 26, 2016"

With the latest update to the Bose Soundtouch 20, I can ask Alexa to play music, give me the news/scores etc via Bluetooth and the Bose won't shut off like it I did before the update (Bose) Dec1, 2016.  Dot functions just like a regular Echo but with great sound from my Bose Soundtouch 20!  I'm a happy camper!!","December 2, 2016"

Super easy way to get started with the Echo platform and economical as well. Very handy for all sorts of quick questions - news, sports scores, weather and general information. Also helpful as a hands-free timer, which is great for cooking. Can't wait to see where this goes in the future.","November 21, 2016"

So I keep it attached to a Bluetooth speaker and I get better volume out of it. Since I don't know what kind of warranty is on the item, I will live with it.","February 7, 2017"

I have a Tap but honestly I love the Dot more.","January 8, 2017"

I set it up to work with my smartthings hub and with a side by side comparison the dot is much more of a let down than the Google Home Assistant.  It was much more difficult to control the lights in the house and the TV.  The voice recognition is pretty good, but could be better.","January 16, 2017"

Works well. One thing to note is obviously the volume is not nearly as loud or a throaty as the large version.","December 27, 2016"
"4.0 out of 5 stars","Greg","App lagging behind hardware.","The hardware is great, but the Alexa app is still very basic and difficult to delete all the saved commands.  I also don't need to hear Ok! each time I turn on or off lights.  When the lights turn on or off, that is all I need. Lastly, when music is turned up to 8 or more, Alexa can no longer hear my commands.  Not sure how to solve that.","January 20, 2017"

Just ask Alexa to play Johnny Cash and the man in black will sing for you. Alexa can answer basic questions, but keep them simple. The sound is surprisingly good for such a small device but you will probably wat to connect it to an external speaker. It's a bargain for $50.","December 8, 2016"

"5.0 out of 5 stars","Anthony A","As advertised","Absolutely in love with this thing. What I appreciate the most is that it understands my 7 and 4 year old children. The one draw back, which isn't necessarily the dot's fault, is the fact that there are 3,000-plus skills and I'd say over half of them are irrelevant. Some of the apps can use some fine tuning. But as far the echo dot itself, I love it.","November 7, 2016"
